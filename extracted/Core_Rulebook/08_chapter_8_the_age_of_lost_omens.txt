Chapter 8: the age of lost omens
The setting of Golarion is described in this chapter,
including a brief overview of the world and its people,
followed by a timeline of events. Most importantly,
characters who venerate a deity should look to this
chapter to find the rules associated with their faith.
Chapter 9: Playing the Game
This important chapter contains the universal rules
needed to play Pathfinder, including rules for the various
modes of play, the basic actions that every character can
perform, the rules for combat, and the rules for death and
dying. Every player should be familiar with this chapter,
especially the GM.
Chapter 10: Game Mastering
Packed full of guidelines and advice, this chapter helps
Game Masters tell an interesting and compelling story.
It also includes advice on creating a fun and encouraging
game space and guides for empowering players to create
characters they want to play. This chapter also includes
rules that are particularly important for the GM to know,
such as rules dealing with traps, environmental dangers,
and afflictions (such as curses, diseases, and poisons), as
well as guidance on setting DCs and handing out rewards
to player characters.
Chapter 11: Crafting & Treasure
The treasures characters find during their adventures
take many forms, from gold and gemstones to powerful
magical weapons. This chapter details guidelines for
distributing treasure to characters, as well as descriptions
of hundreds of magic items. This chapter also contains
the rules for alchemical items.
Appendices
The back of this book has an appendix with the rules
for all of the conditions that you will find in the game.
This section also includes a blank character sheet, and an
index with a comprehensive glossary of common terms
and traits that you’ll encounter in the game.

Format of Rules Elements
Throughout this rulebook, you will see formatting standards that might look a
bit unusual at first. Specifically, the game’s rules are set apart in this text using
specialized capitalization and italicization. These standards are in place to make
this book rules elements easier to recognize.
The names of specific statistics, skills, feats, actions, and some other mechanical
elements in Pathfinder are capitalized. This way, when you see the statement “a Strike
targets Armor Class,” you know that both Strike and Armor Class are referring
to rules.
If a word or a phrase is italicized, it is describing a spell or a magic item. This way,
when you see the statement “the door is sealed by lock,” you know that in this case
the word denotes the lock spell, rather than a physical item.
Pathfinder also uses many terms that are typically expressed as abbreviations, like
AC for Armor Class, DC for Difficulty Class, and HP for Hit Points. If you’re ever
confused about a game term or an abbreviation, you can always turn to the Glossary
and Index, beginning on page 628, and look it up.
Understanding Actions
Characters and their adversaries affect the world of Pathfinder by using actions
and producing effects. This is especially the case during encounters, when every
action counts. When you use an action, you generate an effect. This effect might
be automatic, but sometimes actions necessitate that you roll a die, and the effect is
based on what you rolled.
Throughout this book, you will see special icons to denote actions.
[one-action] Single Actions
Single actions use this symbol: [one-action]. They’re the simplest, most common type of action.
You can use three single actions on your turn in an encounter, in any order you see fit.
[[reaction] ]Reactions
Reactions use this symbol: [reaction]. These actions can be used even when it’s not your
turn. You get only one reaction per encounter round, and you can use it only when
its specific trigger is fulfilled. Often, the trigger is another creature’s action.
[free-action] ]Free Actions
Free actions use this symbol: [free-action]. Free actions don’t require you to spend any of
your three single actions or your reaction. A free action might have a trigger like
a reaction does. If so, you can use it just like a reaction—even if it’s not your turn.
However, you can use only one free action per trigger, so if you have multiple free
actions with the same trigger, you have to decide which to use. If a free action
doesn’t have a trigger, you use it like a single action, just without spending any of
your actions for the turn.
Activities
Activities are special tasks that you complete by spending one or more of your actions
together. Usually, an activity uses two or more actions and lets you do more than a
single action would allow. You have to spend all the actions an activity requires for
its effects to happen. Spellcasting is one of the most common activities, as most spells
take more than a single action to cast.
Activities that use two actions use this symbol: [two-actions]. Activities that use three
actions use this symbol: [three-actions]. A few special activities, such as spells you can cast in
an instant, can be performed by spending a free action or a reaction.
All tasks that take longer than a turn are activities. If an activity is meant to
be done during exploration, it has the exploration trait. An activity that takes a
day or more of commitment and that can be done only during downtime has the
downtime trait.

Reading Rules
This book contains hundreds of rules elements that
give characters new and interesting ways to respond to
situations in the game. All characters can use the basic
actions found in Chapter 9, but an individual character
often has special rules that allow them to do things most
other characters can’t. Most of these options are feats,
which are gained by making certain choices at character
creation or when a character advances in level.
Regardless of the game mechanic they convey, rules
elements are always presented in the form of a stat block,
a summary of the rules necessary to bring the monster,
character, item, or other rules element to life during play.
Where appropriate, stat blocks are introduced with an
explanation of their format. For example, the Ancestry
section of Chapter 2 contains rules for each of the game’s
six core ancestries, and an explanation of these rules
appears at the beginning of that chapter.
The general format for stat blocks is shown below. Entries
are omitted from a stat block when they don’t apply, so not
all rule elements have all of the entries given below. Actions,
reactions, and free actions each have the corresponding icon
next to their name to indicate their type. An activity that
can be completed in a single turn has a symbol indicating
how many actions are needed to complete it; activities that
take longer to perform omit these icons. If a character must
attain a certain level before accessing an ability, that level
is indicated to the right of the stat block’s name. Rules also
often have traits associated with them (traits appear in the
Glossary and Index).
Spells, alchemical items, and magic items use a similar
format, but their stat blocks contain a number of unique
elements (see Chapter 7 for more on reading spells, and
Chapter 11 for more on alchemical and magic items).

Prerequisites Any minimum ability scores, feats, proficiency
ranks, or other prerequisites you must have before you can
access this rule element are listed here. Feats also have a level
prerequisite, which appears above.
Frequency This is the limit on how many times you can use
the ability within a given time.
Trigger Reactions and some free actions have triggers that
must be met before they can be used.
Requirements Sometimes you must have a certain item or be
in a certain circumstance to use an ability. If so, it’s listed
in this section.
This section describes the effects or benefits of a rule element.
If the rule is an action, it explains what the effect is or what
you must roll to determine the effect. If it’s a feat that modifies
an existing action or grants a constant effect, the benefit is
explained here.
Special Any special qualities of the rule are explained in
this section. Usually this section appears in feats you can select
more than once, explaining what happens when you do.

Character Creation
Unless you’re the GM, the first thing you need to do when
playing Pathfinder is create your character. It’s up to you to
imagine your character’s past experiences, personality, and
worldview, and this will set the stage for your roleplaying
during the game. You’ll use the game’s mechanics to
determine your character’s ability to perform various tasks
and use special abilities during the game.
This section provides a step-by-step guide for creating a
character using the Pathfinder rules, preceded by a guide to
help you understand ability scores. These scores are a critical
part of your character, and you will be asked to make choices
about them during many of the following steps. The steps of
character creation are presented in a suggested order, but
you can complete them in whatever order you prefer.
Many of the steps on pages 21–28 instruct you to fill out
fields on your character sheet. The character sheet is shown
on pages 24–25; you can find a copy in the back of this book
or online as a free pdf. The character sheet is designed to
be easy to use when you’re actually playing the game—but
creating a character happens in a different order, so you’ll
move back and forth through the character sheet as you
go through the character creation process. Additionally, the
character sheet includes every field you might need, even
though not all characters will have something to put in each
field. If a field on your character sheet is not applicable to
your character, just leave that field blank.
All the steps of character creation are detailed on the
following pages; each is marked with a number that
corresponds to the sample character sheet on pages 24–25,
showing you where the information goes. If the field
you need to fill out is on the third or fourth page of the
character sheet, which aren’t shown, the text will tell you.
If you’re creating a higher-level character, it’s a good
idea to begin with the instructions here, then turn to
page 29 for instructions on leveling up characters.
The Six Ability Scores
One of the most important aspects of your character is
their ability scores. These scores represent your character’s
raw potential and influence nearly every other statistic on
your character sheet. Determining your ability scores is
not done all at once, but instead happens over several
steps during character creation.
Ability scores are split into two main groups: physical
and mental. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are
physical ability scores, measuring your character’s physical
power, agility, and stamina. In contrast, Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma are mental ability scores and
measure your character’s learned prowess, awareness, and
force of personality.
Excellence in an ability score improves the checks and
statistics related to that ability, as described below. When
imagining your character, you should also decide what
ability scores you want to focus on to give you the best
chance at success.
Strength
Strength measures your character’s physical power.
Strength is important if your character plans to engage in
hand-to-hand combat. Your Strength modifier gets added
to melee damage rolls and determines how much your
character can carry.
Dexterity
Dexterity measures your character’s agility, balance, and
reflexes. Dexterity is important if your character plans
to make attacks with ranged weapons or use stealth to
surprise foes. Your Dexterity modifier is also added to
your character’s AC and Reflex saving throws.
Constitution
Constitution measures your character’s overall health
and stamina. Constitution is an important statistic for
all characters, especially those who fight in close combat.
Your Constitution modifier is added to your Hit Points
and Fortitude saving throws.
Intelligence
Intelligence measures how well your character can learn
and reason. A high Intelligence allows your character to
analyze situations and understand patterns, and it means
they can become trained in additional skills and might be
able to master additional languages.
Wisdom
Wisdom measures your character’s common sense,
awareness, and intuition. Your Wisdom modifier is added
to your Perception and Will saving throws.
Charisma
Charisma measures your character’s personal magnetism
and strength of personality. A high Charisma score helps
you influence the thoughts and moods of others.

Ability Score Overview
Each ability score starts at 10, representing human
average, but as you make character choices, you’ll adjust
these scores by applying ability boosts, which increase a
score, and ability flaws, which decrease a score. As you
build your character, remember to apply ability score
adjustments when making the following decisions.
Ancestry: Each ancestry provides ability boosts, and
sometimes an ability flaw. If you are taking any voluntary
flaws, apply them in this step (see the sidebar on page 24).
Background: Your character’s background provides two
ability boosts.
Class: Your character’s class provides an ability boost to
the ability score most important to your class, called your
key ability score.
Determine Scores: After the other steps, you apply four
more ability boosts of your choice. Then, determine your
ability modifiers based on those scores.
Ability Boosts
An ability boost normally increases an ability score’s
value by 2. However, if the ability score to which you’re
applying an ability boost is already 18 or higher, its value
increases by only 1. At 1st level, a character can never
have any ability score that’s higher than 18.
When your character receives an ability boost, the rules
indicate whether it must be applied to a specific ability
score or to one of two specific ability scores, or whether it
is a “free” ability boost that can be applied to any ability
score of your choice. However, when you gain multiple
ability boosts at the same time, you must apply each one to
a different score. Dwarves, for example, receive an ability
boost to their Constitution score and their Wisdom score,
as well as one free ability boost, which can be applied to
any score other than Constitution or Wisdom.
Ability Flaws
Ability flaws are not nearly as common in Pathfinder as
ability boosts. If your character has an ability flaw—likely
from their ancestry—you decrease that ability score by 2.
Ability Modifiers
Once you’ve finalized your ability scores, you can use them
to determine your ability modifiers, which are used in most
other statistics in the game. Find the score in Table 1–1:
Ability Modifiers to determine its ability modifier.

The standard method of generating ability scores that’s
described above works great if you want to create a perfectly
customized, balanced character. But your GM may decide to
add a little randomness to character creation and let the dice
decide what kind of character the players are going to play. In
that case, you can use this alternative method to generate your
ability scores. Be warned—the same randomness that makes
this system fun also allows it to sometimes create characters
that are significantly more (or less) powerful than the standard
ability score system and other Pathfinder rules assume.
If your GM opts for rolling ability scores, follow these
alternative steps, ignoring all other instructions and guidelines
about applying ability boosts and ability flaws throughout the
character generation process.
STEP 1: ROLL AND ASSIGN SCORES
Roll four 6-sided dice (4d6) and discard the lowest die result.
Add the three remaining results together and record the sum.
(For example, if you rolled a 2, 4, 5, and 6, you would discard
the 2 and your total would be 15.) Repeat this process until
you’ve generated six such values. Decide which value you want
for each of your ability scores.
STEP 2: ASSIGN ABILITY BOOSTS AND
ABILITY FLAWS
Apply the ability boosts your character gains from their
ancestry, but your character gets one fewer free ability
boost than normal. If your character’s ancestry has any
ability flaws, apply those next. Finally, apply one ability
boost to one of the ability scores specified in the character’s
background (you do not get the other free ability boost).
These ability boosts cannot raise a score above 18. If this
would happen, you can put the ability boost into another
ability score instead, as if it were a free ability boost, or you
can put it into an ability score of 17 to reach 18 and lose the
excess increase.
STEP 3: RECORD SCORES AND MODIFIERS
Record the final scores and assign the ability modifiers
according to Table 1–1. When your character receives
additional ability boosts at higher levels, you assign them
as any character would.

Step 1
Create a Concept
What sort of hero do you want to play? The answer to
this question might be as simple as “a brave warrior,” or as
complicated as “the child of elven wanderers, but raised in a
city dominated by humans and devoted to Sarenrae, goddess
of the sun.” Consider your character’s personality, sketch out
a few details about their past, and think about how and why
they adventure. You’ll want to peruse Pathfinder’s available
ancestries, backgrounds, and classes. The summaries on
pages 22–23 might help you match your concept with some
of these basic rule elements. Before a game begins, it’s also
a good idea for the players to discuss how their characters
might know each other and how they’ll work together
throughout the course of their adventures.
There are many ways to approach your character concept.
Once you have a good idea of the character you’d like to
play, move on to Step 2 to start building your character.
Ancestry, Background, Class, or Details
If one of Pathfinder’s character ancestries, backgrounds,
or classes particularly intrigues you, it’s easy to build a
character concept around these options. The summaries of
ancestries and classes on pages 22–23 give a brief overview
of these options (full details appear in Chapters 2 and 3,
respectively). Each ancestry also has several heritages that
might refine your concept further, such as a human with an
elf or orc parent, or an arctic or woodland elf. Additionally,
the game has many backgrounds to choose from,
representing your character’s upbringing, their family’s
livelihood, or their earliest profession. Backgrounds are
detailed later in Chapter 2, beginning on page 60.
Building a character around a specific ancestry,
background, or class can be a fun way to interact with the
world’s lore. Would you like to build a typical member
of your character’s ancestry or class, as described in the
relevant entry, or would you prefer to play a character
who defies commonly held notions about their people?
For example, you could play a dwarf with a wide-eyed
sense of wonder and a zest for change, or a performing
rogue capable of amazing acrobatic feats but with little
interest in sneaking about.
You can draw your concept from any aspect of a
character’s details. You can use roleplaying to challenge
not only the norms of Pathfinder’s fictional world, but
even real-life societal norms. Your character might
challenge gender notions, explore cultural identity, have a
disability, or any combination of these suggestions. Your
character can live any life you see fit.
Faith
Perhaps you’d like to play a character who is a devout
follower of a specific deity. Pathfinder is a rich world with
myriad faiths and philosophies spanning a wide range,
from Cayden Cailean, the Drunken Hero of good-hearted
adventuring; to Desna, the Song of Spheres and goddess of
dreaming and the stars; to Iomedae, the Inheritor, goddess
of honor, justice, and rulership. Pathfinder’s major deities
appear on pages 437–440. Your character might be so
drawn to a particular faith that you decide they should be a
champion or cleric of that deity; they might instead be a lay
worshipper who applies their faith’s teachings to daily life,
or simply the child of devout parents.
Your Allies
You might want to coordinate with other players when
forming your character concept. Your characters could
have something in common already; perhaps they are
relatives, or travelers from the same village. You might
discuss mechanical aspects with the other players, creating
characters whose combat abilities complement each
other. In the latter case, it can be helpful for a party to
include characters who deal damage, characters who can
absorb damage, and characters who can provide healing.
However, Pathfinder’s classes include a lot of choices, and
there are many options for building each type of character,
so don’t let these broad categories restrict your decisions.
CHARACTER SHEET
Once you’ve developed your character’s concept, jot down
a few sentences summarizing your ideas under the Notes
section on the third page of your character sheet. Record
any of the details you’ve already decided, such as your
character’s name, on the appropriate lines on the first page.
ANCESTRIES AND CLASSES
Each player takes a different approach to creating a
character. Some want a character who will fit well into the
story, while others look for a combination of abilities that
complement each other mechanically. You might combine
these two approaches. There is no wrong way!
When you turn the page, you’ll see a graphical
representation of ancestries and classes that provide at-aglance information for players looking to make the most of
their starting ability scores. In the ancestries overview on
page 22, each entry lists which ability scores it boosts, and
also indicates any ability flaws the ancestry might have.
You can find more about ability boosts and ability flaws in
Ability Scores on page 20.
The summaries of the classes on pages 22–23 list each
class’s key ability score—the ability score used to calculate
the potency of many of their class abilities. Characters
receive an ability boost in that ability score when you choose
their class. This summary also lists one or more secondary
ability scores important to members of that class.
Keep in mind a character’s background also affects their
ability scores, though there’s more flexibility in the ability
boosts from backgrounds than in those from classes. For
descriptions of the available backgrounds, see pages 60–64.

Speed, and languages, and contributes to their Hit Points.
Each also grants ability boosts and ability flaws to represent
the ancestry’s basic capabilities.
You’ll make four decisions when you select your
character’s ancestry:
• Pick the ancestry itself.
• Assign any free ability boosts and decide if you are
taking any voluntary flaws.
• Select a heritage from those available within that
ancestry, further defining the traits your character
was born with.
• Choose an ancestry feat, representing an ability your
hero learned at an early age.
CHARACTER SHEET
Write your character’s ancestry and heritage in the
appropriate space at the top of your character sheet’s first
page. Adjust your ability scores, adding 2 to an ability
score if you gained an ability boost from your ancestry, and
subtracting 2 from an ability score if you gained an ability
flaw from your ancestry. Note the number of Hit Points your
character gains from their ancestry—you’ll add more to this
number later. Finally, in the appropriate spaces, record your
character’s size, Speed, and languages. If your character’s
ancestry provides them with special abilities, write them
in the appropriate spaces, such as darkvision in the Senses
Step 2
Start Building
Ability Scores
At this point, you need to start building your character’s
ability scores. See the overview of ability scores on pages
19–20 for more information about these important
aspects of your character and an overview of the process.
Your character’s ability scores each start at 10, and as
you select your ancestry, background, and class, you’ll apply
ability boosts, which increase a score by 2, and ability flaws,
which decrease a score by 2. At this point, just note a 10 in
each ability score and familiarize yourself with the rules for
ability boosts and flaws on page 20. This is also a good time
to identify which ability scores will be most important to
your character. See The Six Ability Scores on page 19 and
the class summaries on pages 22–23 for more information.
Step 3
Select an Ancestry
Select an ancestry for your character. The ancestry
summaries on page 22 provide an overview of Pathfinder’s
core ancestry options, and each is fully detailed in
Chapter 2. Ancestry determines your character’s size,

section on the first page and innate spells on the fourth
page. Write the ancestry feat you selected in the Ancestry
Feat section on your character sheet’s second page.
Step 4
Pick a Background
Your character’s background might represent their
upbringing, an aptitude they’ve been honing since their
youth, or another aspect of their life before they became an
adventurer. Character backgrounds appear in Chapter 2,
starting on page 60. They typically provide two ability
boosts (one that can be applied to either of two specific
ability scores, and one that is free), training in a specific
skill, training in a Lore skill, and a specific skill feat.
CHARACTER SHEET
Record your character’s background in the space at the
top of the first page of your character sheet. Adjust
your ability scores, adding 2 to an ability score if you
gained an ability boost from your background. Record
the skill feat the background provides in the Skill Feat
section of your character sheet’s second page. On the
first page, check the “T” box next to the name of the
specific skill and for one Lore skill to indicate your
character is trained, then write the name of the Lore
skill granted by your background.
Step 5
Choose a Class
At this point, you need to decide your character’s class.
A class gives your character access to a suite of heroic
abilities, determines how effectively they fight, and
governs how easily they can shake off or avoid certain
harmful effects. Each class is fully detailed in Chapter 3,
but the summaries on pages 22–23 provide an overview
of each and tells you which ability scores are important
when playing that class.
You don’t need to write down all of your character’s
class features yet. You simply need to know which class
you want to play, which determines the ability scores that
will be most important for your character.
CHARACTER SHEET
Write your character’s class in the space at the top of the
first page of your character sheet, then write “1” in the
Level box to indicate that your character is 1st level. Next
to the ability scores, note the class’s key ability score,
and add 2 to that ability score from the ability boost the

OPTIONAL:
VOLUNTARY FLAWS
Sometimes, it’s fun to play a
character with a major flaw even
if you’re not playing an ancestry
that imposes one. You can elect
to take two additional ability
flaws when applying the ability
boosts and ability flaws from
your ancestry. If you do, you can
also apply one additional free
ability boost. These ability flaws
can be assigned to any ability
score you like, but you can’t apply
more than one ability flaw to the
same ability score during this
step unless you apply both of the
additional ability flaws to a score
that is already receiving an ability
boost during this step. In this
case, the first ability flaw cancels
the ability boost, and the second
ability flaw decreases the score
by 2. Likewise, as an exception
to the normal rules for ability
boosts, you can apply two free
ability boosts to an ability score
receiving an ability flaw during
this step; the first ability boost
cancels the ability flaw, and the
second ability boost increases the
score by 2. For example, a dwarf
normally gets an ability boost to
Constitution and Wisdom, along
with an ability flaw to Charisma.
You could apply one ability flaw
each to Intelligence and Strength,
or you could apply both ability
flaws to Wisdom. You could not
apply either additional ability flaw
to Charisma, though, because it is
already receiving dwarves’ ability
flaw during this step.
class provides. Don’t worry about recording the rest of your character’s class features
and abilities yet—you’ll handle that in Step 7.
Step 6
Determine Ability Scores
Now that you’ve made the main mechanical choices about your character, it’s time
to finalize their ability scores. Do these three things:
• First, make sure you’ve applied all the ability boosts and ability flaws you’ve
noted in previous steps (from your ancestry, background, and class).
• Then, apply four more ability boosts to your character’s ability scores,
choosing a different ability score for each and increasing that ability score
by 2.
• Finally, record your starting ability scores and ability modifiers, as determined
using Table 1–1: Ability Modifiers.
Remember that each ability boost adds 2 to the base score of 10, and each ability
flaw subtracts 2. You should have no ability score lower than 8 or higher than 18.
CHARACTER SHEET
Write your character’s starting ability scores in the box provided for each. Record
the ability modifier for each ability score in the box to the left of the ability’s name.
Step 7
Record Class Details
Now, record all the benefits and class features that your character receives from the
class you’ve chosen. While you’ve already noted your key ability score, you’ll want to
be sure to record the following class features.
• To determine your character’s total starting Hit Points, add together the
number of Hit Points your character gains from their ancestry (chosen in
Step 2) and the number of Hit Points they gain from their class.
• The Initial Proficiencies section of your class entry indicates your character’s
starting proficiency ranks in a number of areas. Choose which skills your
character is trained in and record those, along with the ones set by your class. If
your class would make you trained in a skill you’re already trained in (typically
due to your background), you can select another skill to become trained in.
• See the class advancement table in your class entry to learn the class features
your character gains at 1st level—but remember, you already chose an
ancestry and background. Some class features require you to make additional
choices, such as selecting spells.
CHARACTER SHEET
Write your character’s total Hit Points on the first page of your character sheet. Use
the proficiency fields (the boxes marked “T,” “E,” “M,” and “L”) on your character sheet to
record your character’s initial proficiencies in Perception, saving throws, and the skills
granted by their class; mark “T” if your character is trained, or “E” if your character is
expert. Indicate which additional skills you chose for your character to be trained in
by marking the “T” proficiency box for each skill you selected. Likewise, record your
character’s their armor proficiencies in the Armor Class section at the top of the first
page and their weapon proficiencies at the bottom of the first page. Record all other
class feats and abilities on the second page. Don’t worry yet about finalizing any values
for your character’s statistics—you’ll handle that in Step 9.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 28
================================================================================

SPELLS AND
SPELLCASTING
Most classes can learn to cast a
few focus spells, but the bard,
cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard
all gain spellcasting—the ability
to cast a wide variety of spells.
If your character’s class grants
spells, you should take time
during Step 7 to learn about the
spells they know and how to
cast them. The fourth page of the
character sheet provides space
to note your character’s magic
tradition and their proficiency
rank for spell attack rolls and
spell DCs. It also gives ample
space to record the spells in
your character’s repertoire or
spellbook, or that you prepare
frequently. Each class determines
which spells a character can
cast, how they are cast, and how
many they can cast in a day,
but the spells themselves and
detailed rules for spellcasting are
located in Chapter 7.
Step 8
Buy Equipment
At 1st level, your character has 15 gold pieces (150 silver pieces) to spend on
armor, weapons, and other basic equipment. Your character’s class lists the types
of weapons and armor with which they are trained (or better!). Their weapons
determine how much damage they deal in combat, and their armor influences their
Armor Class; these calculations are covered in more detail in Step 10. Don’t forget
essentials such as food and traveling gear! For more on the available equipment and
how much it costs, see Chapter 6.
CHARACTER SHEET
Once you’ve spent your character’s starting wealth, calculate any remaining gp, sp,
and cp they might still have and write those amounts in Inventory on the second
page. Record your character’s weapons in the Melee Strikes and Ranged Strikes
sections of the first page, depending on the weapon, and the rest of their equipment
in the Inventory section on your character sheet’s second page. You’ll calculate
specific numbers for melee Strikes and ranged Strikes with the weapons in Step 9
and for AC when wearing that armor in Step 10.
Step 9
Calculate Modifiers
With most of the big decisions for your character made, it’s time to calculate the
modifiers for each of the following statistics. If your proficiency rank for a statistic is
trained, expert, master, and legendary, your bonus equals your character’s level plus
another number based on the rank (2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively). If your character is
untrained, your proficiency bonus is +0.
Perception
Your character’s Perception modifier measures how alert they are. This modifier is
equal to their proficiency bonus in Perception plus their Wisdom modifier. For more
about Perception, see page 448.
Saving Throws
For each kind of saving throw, add your character’s Fortitude, Reflex, or Will
proficiency bonus (as appropriate) plus the ability modifier associated with that
kind of saving throw. For Fortitude saving throws, use your character’s Constitution
modifier. For Reflex saving throws, use your character’s Dexterity modifier. For Will
saving throws, use your character’s Wisdom modifier. Then add in any bonuses or
penalties from abilities, feats, or items that always apply (but not modifiers, bonuses,
or penalties that apply only in certain situations). Record this number on the line for
that saving throw.
Melee Strikes and Ranged Strikes
Next to where you’ve written your character’s melee and ranged weapons, calculate
the modifier to Strike with each weapon and how much damage that Strike deals. The
modifier for a Strike is equal to your character’s proficiency bonus with the weapon plus
an ability modifier (usually Strength for melee Strikes and Dexterity for ranged Strikes).
You also add any item bonus from the weapon and any other permanent bonuses or
penalties. You also need to calculate how much damage each weapon’s Strike deals.
Melee weapons usually add your character’s Strength modifier to damage rolls, while
ranged weapons might add some or all of your character’s Strength modifier, depending
on the weapon’s traits. See the weapon entries in Chapter 6 for more information.

Skills
In the second box to the right of each skill name on your
character sheet, there’s an abbreviation that reminds you
of the ability score tied to that skill. For each skill in which
your character is trained, add your proficiency bonus for
that skill (typically +3 for a 1st-level character) to the
indicated ability’s modifier, as well as any other applicable
bonuses and penalties, to determine the total modifier for
that skill. For skills your character is untrained in, use the
same method, but your proficiency bonus is +0.
CHARACTER SHEET
For Perception and saving throws, write your proficiency
bonus and the appropriate ability modifier in the boxes
provided, then record the total modifier in the large space.
Record the proficiency bonuses, ability modifiers, and total
modifiers for your melee Strikes and ranged Strikes in the
box after the name of each weapon, and put the damage
for each in the space below, along with the traits for that
attack. For skills, record the relevant ability modifier and
proficiency bonus in the appropriate box for each skill, and
then write the total skill modifiers in the spaces to the left.
If your character has any modifiers, bonuses, or
penalties from feats or abilities that always apply, add
them into the total modifiers. For ones that apply only in
certain situations, note them next to the total modifiers.
10 Step 10
Finishing Details
Now add the following details to your character sheet in
the appropriate spaces.
Alignment
Your character’s alignment is an indicator of their
morality and personality. There are nine possible
alignments in Pathfinder, as shown on Table 1–2: The
Nine Alignments. If your alignment has any components
other than neutral, your character gains the traits of those
alignment components. This might affect the way various
spells, items, and creatures interact with your character.
Your character’s alignment is measured by two pairs of
opposed values: the axis of good and evil and the axis of
law and chaos. A character who isn’t committed strongly
to either side is neutral on that axis. Keep in mind that
alignment is a complicated subject, and even acts that might
be considered good can be used for nefarious purposes, and
vice versa. The GM is the arbiter of questions about how
specific actions might affect your character’s alignment.
If you play a champion, your character’s alignment
must be one allowed for their deity and cause
(pages 437–440 and 106–107), and if you play a cleric,
your character’s alignment must be one allowed for their
deity (pages 437–440).
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 30
================================================================================

Good and Evil
Your character has a good alignment if they consider the
happiness of others above their own and work selflessly to
assist others, even those who aren’t friends and family. They
are also good if they value protecting others from harm,
even if doing so puts the character in danger. Your character
has an evil alignment if they’re willing to victimize others
for their own selfish gain, and even more so if they enjoy
inflicting harm. If your character falls somewhere in the
middle, they’re likely neutral on this axis.
Law and Chaos
Your character has a lawful alignment if they value
consistency, stability, and predictability over flexibility.
Lawful characters have a set system in life, whether it’s
meticulously planning day-to-day activities, carefully
following a set of official or unofficial laws, or strictly
adhering to a code of honor. On the other hand, if your
character values flexibility, creativity, and spontaneity over
consistency, they have a chaotic alignment—though this
doesn’t mean they make decisions by choosing randomly.
Chaotic characters believe that lawful characters are too
inflexible to judge each situation by its own merits or take
advantage of opportunities, while lawful characters believe
that chaotic characters are irresponsible and flighty.
Many characters are in the middle, obeying the law
or following a code of conduct in many situations, but
bending the rules when the situation requires it. If your
character is in the middle, they are neutral on this axis.
Changing Alignment
Alignment can change during play as a character’s beliefs
change, or as you realize that your character’s actions
reflect a different alignment than the one on your character
sheet. In most cases, you can just change their alignment
and continue playing. However, if you play a cleric or
champion and your character’s alignment changes to one
not allowed for their deity (or cause, for champions), your
character loses some of their class abilities until they atone
(as described in the class).
Deity
Write down the deity your character worships, if any.
Champions and clerics must worship a deity. See pages
437–440 for more about Pathfinder’s deities.
Age
Decide your character’s age and note it on the third page
of the character sheet. The description for your character’s
ancestry in Chapter 2 gives some guidance on the age
ranges of members of that ancestry. Beyond that, you can
play a character of whatever age you like. There aren’t
any mechanical adjustments to your character for being
particularly old, but you might want to take it into account
when considering your starting ability scores and future
advancement. Particularly young characters can change
the tone of some of the game’s threats, so it’s recommended
that characters are at least young adults.
Gender and Pronouns
Characters of all genders are equally likely to become
adventurers. Record your character’s gender, if applicable,
and their pronouns on the third page of the character sheet.
Class DC
A class DC sets the difficulty for certain abilities granted
by your character’s class. This DC equals 10 plus their
proficiency bonus for their class DC (+3 for most 1st-level
characters) plus the modifier for the class’s key ability score.
Hero Points
Your character usually begins each game session with
1 Hero Point, and you can gain additional Hero Points
during sessions by performing heroic deeds or devising
clever strategies. Your character can use Hero Points to
gain certain benefits, such as staving off death or rerolling
a d20. See page 467 for more about Hero Points.
Armor Class (AC)
Your character’s Armor Class represents how difficult they
are to hit in combat. To calculate your AC, add 10 plus
your character’s Dexterity modifier (up to their armor’s
Dexterity modifier cap; page 274), plus their proficiency
bonus with their armor, plus their armor’s item bonus to
AC and any other permanent bonuses and penalties.
Bulk
Your character’s maximum Bulk determines how much
weight they can comfortably carry. If they’re carrying a total
amount of Bulk that exceeds 5 plus their Strength modifier,
they are encumbered. A character can’t carry a total amount
of Bulk that exceeds 10 plus their Strength modifier. The
Bulk your character is carrying equals the sum of all of their
items; keep in mind that 10 light items make up 1 Bulk. You
can find out more about Bulk in Chapter 6: Equipment.

Sample Character
This step-by-step example illustrates the process of
creating a Pathfinder character.
Steps 1 and 2
Adam is making his first Pathfinder character. After
talking about it with the rest of the group, he’s decided to
make a dwarven druid. After jotting down a few ideas, he
begins by writing down a 10 for each ability score.
Step 3
Adam looks up the dwarf entry in Chapter 2. He records
the ability boosts to his Constitution and Wisdom scores
(bringing both up to 12). He also applies the ability flaw
to his Charisma, dropping it to 8. For his free ability
boost, he chooses Dexterity to boost his defenses, raising
it to 12 as well. He also records the 10 Hit Points the
ancestry gives him. Next, he returns to his character
sheet to record the size, Speed, language, and darkvision
ability he gets from being a dwarf. Finally, he decides on
a heritage, writing “rock dwarf” next to dwarf, and he
picks an ancestry feat, deciding on Rock Runner, to show
his character’s strong connection to stone.
Step 4
Looking through the backgrounds, Adam likes the idea
of a solitary dwarven druid, and the nomad background
makes for a good choice. For the first ability boost
granted by the background, Adam chooses Wisdom, and
for the free ability boost, he choses Constitution, taking
both up to 14. On the second page, he writes “Assurance
(Survival)” in the Skill Feats area, on the Background line.
Finally, returning to the first page, he writes “cave” next
to the first Lore skill entry and checks the box under the
“T” for that skill and Survival.
Step 5
Adam writes “druid” on the class line of his character sheet
and fills in the number 1 in the level box. The druid class
grants an ability boost to its key ability score, which is
Wisdom, so Adam’s character has his Wisdom raised to 16.
Step 6
Adam applies four more ability boosts to his ability
scores to determine his starting scores. After giving it
some thought, he applies them to Wisdom (raising it
to 18), since that’s the most important ability score for
his class, and to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
(raising them to 12, 14, and 16, respectively) to make him
better in combat. He then looks at Table 1–1 to determine
the ability modifiers for each score and writes all of his
ability scores and modifiers down on his character sheet.
Step 7
As Adam applies his class, he has a number of things to
figure out. First, he starts by recording all of his initial
proficiencies, marking the appropriate boxes in the
Armor Class, Saving Throws, Weapon Proficiencies, Spell
Attack Roll, and Spell DCs areas of his sheet. Turning to
skills, he marks Nature as trained and notes that once he
picks his druid order, he’ll become trained in another skill
determined by that order. He then gets to choose three
more skills (if he had a higher Intelligence, he would have
gotten more). He decides on Athletics, Diplomacy, and
Medicine, marking all of them as trained. Next, he adds
the 8 Hit Points from the druid class and his Constitution
modifier of +3 to the 10 Hit Points from his dwarf
ancestry for an impressive 21 total Hit Points.
Moving on to class features, Adam marks down wild
empathy in the class feats and abilities area, as well as the
Shield Block feat in the bonus feats area. He makes note of
the anathema for being a druid and records Druidic in his
language section. Next, he looks through the druid orders
and decides upon the wild order, which gives him his final
trained skill (Intimidation), the ability to cast wild morph,
as well as the Wild Shape feat, which lets him cast a spell
to turn into an animal. He writes these spells in the focus
spell area of his character sheet and also notes that he has
1 Focus Point to use to cast these spells.
Finally, a druid can cast a limited number of primal
spells. Although he can change them every morning, Adam
is curious, and he turns to Chapter 7: Spells to decide
what spells he might cast. He jots down five cantrips and
two 1st-level spells and marks them as prepared.
Step 8
Next up, Adam turns to Chapter 6: Equipment. He’s
trained in medium armor, but since wearing metal armor is
anathema to druids, he chooses hide armor. For weapons,
he decides on a spear, but he buys two just in case he wants
to throw the first one. He writes all of these on the front of
his character sheet. Adam lists the spear under both melee
Strikes and ranged Strikes, and he also writes the claws he
gains from wild morph under his melee Strikes, because
he’s sure that he’ll be casting that spell a lot. He records the
rest of his gear in the Inventory section on the second page,
along with coin left over after buying his starting gear.
Step 9
Adam records all of the ability modifiers for Perception,
saving throws, Strikes, and skills. He then puts a “+3” in
the box marked Prof to indicate his proficiency bonus
for each statistic he’s trained in (1 for his level, plus 2 for
being trained) and "+5" in any that he is an expert. Then,
he adds up his modifiers for each statistic.
Step 10
Finally, Adam fills out the final details of his character,
noting his neutral alignment and calculating his AC and
Bulk limits. Last but not least, he fills in some last-minute
information about his character and decides on a name.
Gar the dwarf druid is ready for his first adventure!

Leveling Up
The world of Pathfinder is a dangerous place, and your
character will face terrifying beasts and deadly traps on
their journey into legend. With each challenge resolved,
a character earns Experience Points (XP) that allow
them to increase in level. Each level grants greater skill,
increased resiliency, and new capabilities, allowing your
character to face even greater challenges and go on to
earn even more impressive rewards.
Each time your character reaches 1,000 Experience
Points, their level increases by 1. On your character
sheet, indicate your character’s new level beside the
name of their class, and deduct 1,000 XP from their XP
total. If you have any Experience Points left after this,
record them—they count toward your next level, so your
character is already on their way to advancing yet again!
Next, return to your character’s class entry. Increase
your character’s total Hit Points by the number indicated
for your class. Then, take a look at the class advancement
table and find the row for your character’s new level.
Your character gains all the abilities listed for that
level, including new abilities specific to your class and
additional benefits all characters gain as they level up.
For example, all characters gain four ability boosts at 5th
level and every 5 levels thereafter.
You can find all the new abilities specific to your class,
including class feats, right in your class entry, though you
can also use class feats to take an archetype (page 219).
Your character’s class entry also explains how to apply
any ability boosts and skill increases your character gains.
If they gain an ancestry feat, head back to the entry for
your character’s ancestry in Chapter 2 and select another
ancestry feat from the list of options. If they gain a skill
increase, refer to Chapter 4 when deciding which skill
to apply it to. If they gain a general feat or a skill feat,
you can choose from the feats listed in Chapter 5. If they
can cast spells, see the class entry for details on adding
spell slots and spells. It’s also a good idea to review
your character’s spells in Chapter 7 and see if there are
heightened versions they can now cast.
Once you’ve made all your choices for your
character’s new level, be sure to go over your character
sheet and adjust any values that have changed. At a bare
minimum, your proficiency bonuses all increase by 1
because you’ve gained a level, so your AC, attack rolls,
Perception, saving throws, skill modifiers, spell attack
rolls, and class DC all increase by at least 1. You might
need to change other values because of skill increases,
ability boosts, or class features that either increase your
proficiency rank or increase other statistics at certain
levels. If an ability boost increases your character’s
Constitution modifier, recalculate their maximum Hit
Points using their new Constitution modifier (typically
this adds 1 Hit Point per level). If an ability boost
increases your character’s Intelligence modifier, they
become trained in an additional skill and language.
Some feats grant a benefit based on your level, such
as Toughness, and these benefits are adjusted whenever
you gain a level as well.
You can perform the steps in the leveling-up process in
whichever order you want. For example, if you wanted
to take the skill feat Intimidating Prowess as your skill
feat at 10th level, but your character’s Strength score
was only 14, you could first increase their Strength score
to 16 using the ability boosts gained at 10th level, and
then take Intimidating Prowess as a skill feat at the
same level.
Leveling-Up Checklist
Every time you gain a level, make sure you do each of
the following:
• Increase your level by 1 and subtract 1,000 XP
from your XP total.
• Increase your maximum Hit Points by the amount
listed in your class entry in Chapter 3.
• Add class features from your class advancement
table, including ability boosts and skill increases.
• Select feats as indicated on your class advancement
table. For ancestry feats, see Chapter 2. For class
feats, see your class entry in Chapter 3. For general
feats and skill feats, see Chapter 5.
• Add spells and spell slots if your class grants
spellcasting. See Chapter 7 for spells.
• Increase all of your proficiency bonuses by 1
from your new level, and make other increases to
your proficiency bonuses as necessary from skill
increases or other class features. Increase any
other statistics that changed as a result of ability
boosts or other abilities.
• Adjust bonuses from feats and other abilities that
are based on your level.
