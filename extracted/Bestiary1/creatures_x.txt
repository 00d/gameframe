ELEMENTAL CREATURES
Not all elementals are lumbering,
humanoid-shaped creatures. Some
take on the forms and natures
of animals and beasts from the
Material Plane. These creatures
often behave in ways similar to
their Material Plane counterparts,
even though as elementals they
lack the animalistic instincts
mortal creatures have when it
comes to hunting, reproducing,
and the like. Elemental creatures
are favorites of conjurers due to
their small size, relative ease of
summoning, and varied abilities.

Claw Frenzy ʚʖ The xorn makes three claw Strikes; no more than two can be against
the same target. These attacks count toward the xorn’s multiple attack penalty, but
the penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks have been made.

Spike Stones (aura, earth, primal, transmutation) 5 feet. Spikes of rock rise up from all stone
surfaces in the emanation, creating diﬃcult terrain. A creature moving in the terrain takes
2d6 piercing damage for each square of spikes it moves into (a Large or larger creature
takes damage only once for each square it moves, even if its space covers multiple squares
of spikes). Creatures with the earth trait ignore all eﬀects within the area. The stone mauler
can disable or activate spike stones as a single action, which has the concentrate trait.

XULGATH SOCIETY
Xulgaths respect strength, and the
leader of a community is usually the
strongest of all of them. The leader’s
dominance is rarely questioned
until a potentially stronger xulgath
believes it’s time for a change in
rulership. The two xulgaths then
face oﬀ in a ﬁght to the death, with
the victor claiming rule.
Xulgath Skulker
Xulgath warrens are patrolled—some might say “haunted”—by the community’s
skulkers. These xulgaths specialize in stealth, striking swiftly from the shadows
and otherwise ambushing foes.

Stench Suppression Ȳ˓ A xulgath skulker can suppress its stench aura as a free action
to better hide its presence. The skulker can resume its stench aura as a free action.

Melee Ȱɵ dagger +10 (agile, ﬁnesse, versatile S), Damage 1d4+3 piercing

Ranged Ȱɵ dagger +10 (agile, thrown 10 feet, versatile S), Damage 1d4+3 piercing
Hidden Movement If a xulgath skulker starts its turn undetected by a creature or merely
hidden from it, that creature is ﬂat-footed against the skulker’s attacks until the end
of the skulker’s turn.
Sneak Attack A xulgath skulker deals an additional 1d6 precision damage to
ﬂat‑footed creatures.
Xulgath Leader
Xulgath leaders are usually the strongest, most violent
members of a community—although in some cases,
particularly in larger groups, xulgath tribes are led by
powerful demon cultists or other monsters who seek to
use the xulgaths as servants or slaves.

YETI TREASURE
Lone exiles of yeti clans have little
use for treasure and leave the gear
of their slain victims behind where
it is quickly covered by snowfall.
Clan-based yetis, on the other
hand, create beautifully carved
stonework, some of which they
shape into protective talismans of
rare beauty.
Yeti
Nearly a myth, the yeti is rarely seen—and even when it is, it is often too late.
Yetis dwell amid the highest, most remote peaks of the world, coming down
from their snowy mountain holds to raid, steal livestock, and sometimes feed
their insatiable urges for slaughter and destruction. Those folks who live at the
foot of a yeti-ruled mountain warn of the “abominable snowmen”: monstrous,
fur-covered humanoids who leave strange and bloody tracks in the snow.
Normally yetis seek to protect the world rather than hunt its other civilized
denizens. They do so by lairing near eldritch portals that form links between
the Material Plane and other, much stranger dimensions of reality. From within
these snow-covered arches and ancient stone doorways, aliens, living nightmares,
ﬁends, and worse can emerge through dimensional networks into the world. Yetis
who guard these portals sometimes succumb to these horrors and are corrupted,
taking on the bloodthirsty urges and horriﬁc behaviors of the very monsters they
strive to protect the world against. Yetis who manifest such violent tendencies
are driven out of their clan and forced to wander the mountaintops alone, thus
giving rise to the myth of the legendary abominable snowman. Forced to fend
for themselves, these exiled yetis often fully embrace the corrupting elements that
caused their exile in the ﬁrst place, growing more powerful and more deadly as
a result. The most vile of these yetis turn to cannibalism, not out of need, but
out of a sheer joy at the terror they inﬂict upon their kin. Invariably such
cannibalistic yetis attract the attention of wendigos, which makes a bad
situation all the worse.

HP 115; Immunities cold; Weaknesses ﬁre 10
Nightmare Guardian Yetis gain a +4 status bonus to saves against fear and
against spells and abilities that aﬀect dreams. A yeti that falls prey to a
supernatural nightmare loses this ability and becomes permanently enraged,
gaining a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls and a –1 status penalty
to AC.
Vanish Ǻȓ Trigger The yeti is hidden or undetected while not in combat,
and a creature would observe it. Eﬀect The yeti Strides or Climbs up to
half its Speed to a location where it can Hide, then Hides. If its new Stealth
check result meets or exceeds the triggering creature’s Perception DC, the yeti
remains hidden.

Melee Ȱɵ claw +15, Damage 2d10+5 slashing
Grisly Arrival Ȳ˓ (emotion, fear, mental); Trigger The yeti hits a creature in
the ﬁrst round of combat and the yeti was hidden from that creature at
the start of combat. Eﬀect Each enemy within 30 feet that witnesses the
attack (including the target of the attack) must attempt a DC 23 Will
save. On a failure, the creature is frightened 2; on a critical failure, it’s
frightened 4.
