Riding Dog
Riding dogs types include larger dogs, such as mastiffs,
wolfhounds, and huskies, and are bred often by halﬂings
and gnomes to serve as mounts. Riding dogs are as loyal and
devoted to their masters as guard dogs, and are ferocious
in battle, regardless of whether they bear a rider or not. As
with guard dogs, these large hounds can be wild or feral in
nature, and, in some cases, might rival packs of wolves with
regard to the danger they pose to inhabitants of rural areas.

INFILTRATING A PARTY
While incorporating a doppelganger
who inﬁltrates the adventuring
party into your game can lead to
many exciting narrative possibilities,
in practice, it’s not easy (or even
advisable) to pull oﬀ. If you wish
to try, it’s best to make sure you
know your players well and have
their trust. You can take a targeted
player aside to let them know
that, for a time, they’ll be playing a
doppelganger, but take care not to
remove the player’s agency from the
game for too long or too often, as
that can get old fast from the other
side of the GM screen!
Doppelganger
In their natural forms, doppelgangers are humanoid creatures with ﬂesh of
indeterminate color and features that lack ﬁne details, as if unﬁnished. As
masters of mimicry, they use their abilities to impersonate others in devious
ways, often inﬁltrating settlements and residing within them for years without
being detected.
Doppelgangers are incredibly secretive, with some nearing outright paranoia. They
choose their targets carefully and go to great lengths not to reveal their intentions
before their plans come to fruition. Doppelgangers usually inﬁltrate communities
in order to gain some manner of wealth or power, and assume the guises of other
(usually inﬂuential) persons to allow the creatures they’re impersonating to take the
fall for any negative consequences that may result from their actions.
Though most are not evil, doppelgangers are manipulative and self-serving. As
they don’t have their own society and aren’t monolithic in their motivations, an
individual doppelganger has its own unique interests and impulses, though many
are over-indulgent. Some doppelgangers enjoy the thrill of subtlety, while others
favor grander schemes, such as manipulating a nation’s political
infrastructure. Others seek to exploit merchant guilds to gain
immense wealth, while others use their shape-changing ability to
destroy relationships between close friends or families.
Doppelgangers are careful and patient creatures. They are willing
to slowly construct elaborate schemes that may require extended
periods of time—even decades—to yield results.
Doppelgangers often work alone, as they don’t trust potential cohorts
not to ruin their plans. There are rare times when doppelgangers might
reveal secrets to high-ranking individuals to ensure a successful inﬁltration.
When they do work with others, it’s because they’ve taken the shape of a
target group’s leader, unbeknownst to the organization’s members.
Doppelgangers can grow in power by learning skills and
abilities, and often make excellent rogues, spellcasters, or
ﬁghters. A doppelganger that has class abilities can often
effectively inﬁltrate and plague an adventuring group as a
powerful antagonist—but using a doppelganger like this in
your game should be handled with care (see the Inﬁltrating a Party sidebar
above for more information).

GIBBERING MOUTHER
TREASURE
While gibbering mouthers have
little interest in treasure, they are
known to consume their prey’s
valuables along with the creatures’
ﬂesh. Those treasures which are
not themselves digestible remain
until the gibbering mouther
disgorges them or is destroyed.
Gibbering Mouther
Amorphous blobs of yammering mouths and oozing, ﬂeshy sludge, gibbering
mouthers are among the strangest creatures found either aboveground or below.
Perpetually ravenous, these aberrations are always seeking their next meals,
ever eating but never sated. With a nominal intelligence, gibbering mouthers
can understand and even speak Aklo, but they do so in an intelligible manner
only rarely. Instead, their innumerable mouths constantly jabber and babble in a
stream of sound that disrupts the thought patterns of other creatures in the area.
Where, how, and why gibbering mouthers originated are questions without answers.
They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to
theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested
that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal’s attempt to create something akin to
a shoggoth—though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe
gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some
forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little
to say on the matter—at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless
hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers’ noises—studies that put
researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best.
Whatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion.
Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well
as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv. They are
somewhat less common in the upper region of Nar-Voth, perhaps due to the
prevalence of settlements that don’t tolerate gibbering mouthers’ presence.

RATS AND DISEASE
Rats have a reputation of being
vicious, aggressive animals
that attack food stores in great
numbers and spread disease.
While rats are immune to the most
severe eﬀects of their own ﬁlth
fever, the disease makes them
unpredictable and aggressive.
Some populations of rats carry
even more deadly diseases, such
as bubonic plague.
Rat
Rats are a ubiquitous menace, scurrying through the sewers and on the streets of
nearly every settlement the world over. Though a regular rat darting underfoot
might startle or even frighten the average passerby, giant rats and rat swarms are
far more dangerous.
Giant Rat
Giant rats are enormous versions of the common vermin. They are typically found
in abundant numbers, but since they cannot ﬁt in the nooks where mundane rats
typically hide, they are much easier to locate and exterminate. They mostly live in
sewers where they can scavenge from the streets above, but some families of giant
rats live in more remote locations, such as dank caves or forests and hills. Rats
are incredibly adept survivors and can be found nearly anywhere in the world,
though they tend to favor temperate or warm climates as opposed to cold regions.
Although its bite alone is not lethal except to the very young or very old, the
giant rat carries the ﬁlth fever common to rodents around the world—a pestilence
more than capable of ravaging rural communities.

Rat Swarm
A swarm of rats can cause total chaos within a household or business. Contracting
ﬁlth fever is all the easier when dozens of these agitated or hungry vermin
gather to bite victims en masse, making rat-hunting a viable career in many
parts of the world as desperate townspeople seek relief from the
disease’s spread.

RATFOLK LOCATIONS
On Golarion, ysoki are most
numerous in the Darklands below
the continent of Tian Xia, where
they rule a vast empire, but they
can be found in the Inner Sea region
as well—particularly in the badlands
and hills of Numeria, where they
eagerly scavenge and collect
strange technological wonders
and weapons.
Ratfolk
True to their name, ratfolk are rodent-like humanoids well suited to living on the
outskirts of mainstream society. Despite common misconceptions that they are
dirty or diseased, ysoki, as they call themselves, keep impeccably clean. Ratfolk
are also sometimes mistaken for wererats and initially treated with fear until they
can correct the mistaken identiﬁcation—if they get the chance to do so.
In general, ratfolk have a keen understanding of pathological and alchemical
sciences, which they employ in trade and self-defense. They make accomplished
alchemists and tinkerers, and they often protect their lairs with traps, bombs, and
other creations. Ratfolk merchants regularly dispatch large trade caravans that travel
widely for a year or more before returning to their home community. During this time
they make an effort to learn new things from the people they encounter and collect
new, interesting materials and goods that they can bring back to their warrens.
In their warrens, on the road, and in cities, ratfolk are extremely communal,
thriving on proximity to and contact with one another even in relatively tight spaces.
In addition, ratfolk are excellent at ﬁghting in cramped spaces alongside their kin.
Threatening one ratfolk or their allies is a sureﬁre way to rally the whole community.

REDCAP TREASURE
A redcap’s boots and cap are of
little value to other creatures, but
it carries a scythe and various
valuable trophies from its kills.
Redcap
Redcaps are sadistic and capricious fey who thrill in bloodletting and murder.
While they are most famous for appearing as wizened, bearded men, redcap
women are no less fearsome or cruel. Redcaps are ultimately craven bullies,
cowed by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear
and despise the symbols of good deities. Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps
draw power from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just as
iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of
their metal soles clanking on stone ﬂoors is both discordant and disconcerting—
especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically stand
only 3 feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and long, white,
tangled hair.

Red Cap (necromancy, primal) A redcap’s woolen hat is dyed with the blood of its victims.

grant its powers until the redcap has turned it red with Blood Soak. A cap has
no beneﬁt for creatures other than the redcap who made it.

Divine Revulsion (emotion, fear, mental) If a redcap sees a creature
brandish a religious symbol of a good deity (which requires an
interact action by that creature) or use one to cast a divine
spell, the redcap must attempt a DC 19 Will save. It then
becomes temporarily immune to all brandished religious
symbols for 10 minutes.

cap in the blood of a slain foe. The foe must have
died in the last minute, and the redcap must have
helped kill it. The redcap gains a +4 status bonus
to damage rolls for 1 minute.
Deadly Cleave Ǻȓ Trigger The redcap reduces a creature to 0 Hit
Points with a scythe Strike. Eﬀect The redcap makes another
scythe Strike against a diﬀerent creature, using the same multiple
attack penalty as the scythe Strike that triggered this reaction.
This counts toward its multiple attack penalty.
Stomp Ȱɵ The redcap Strides up to half its Speed and makes
a boot Strike at any point during that movement. If the boot
Strike hits a prone creature, it deals an extra 2d6 persistent
bleed damage.
REDCAP LOCATIONS
Unlike some fey, redcaps don’t
embody a particular natural
feature or environment, so they
can be found almost anywhere.
They tend to prefer areas that
allow them to hide or at least
get behind cover with their
quick movement, such as
forests, mountains,
and underground
tunnels and
caverns.

EATING REEFCLAWS
Reefclaws amass no treasure,
but their meat—if kept fresh—can
be sold in the right markets.
However, in an increasing number
of places, the practice of eating
reefclaws has fallen out of favor—
which means, of course, that
the reefclaw market has simply
shifted to black-market butchers,
where all manner of meat
gathered from dubious sources
is available for purchase, and the
value has increased accordingly.
Reefclaw
Reefclaws are aquatic monsters that resemble huge shrimp or lobsters. As
one might expect from its name, a reefclaw’s oversized claws are powerful
weapons with their vicelike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into
unfortunate prey.
While reefclaws can’t speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local
language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes
listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush
aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value—reefclaws are
particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are
usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known
to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal
raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread
hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such
hunting parties are extremely dangerous—they’ve been known to tip over small
ﬁshing boats and attack those who fall overboard.
Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even
if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the
creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from
its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last
slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often
a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and
their offspring.
Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws
frequently ﬁnd their way onto the dinner plates of
land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins.
According to those who have a taste for reefclaw ﬂesh,
the meat is either delectably sweet (for reefclaws
raised in colder waters) or slightly tangy (in the case
of warm-water reefclaws). Most civilized people
who know of reefclaws’ intellect ﬁnd the act of
eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade
unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom
reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense.
Likewise, ﬁsherfolk whose focus is on the bottom
line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt
the dangerous creatures—or, even better, hire out the
task to naive adventurers.

ANCIENT REMORHAZES
A remorhaz has an unusual life
cycle. A remorhaz that survives
long enough (typically a century)
without succumbing to violence
melts a deep hole in the ice and
hibernates for several hundred
years, growing slowly as its internal
heat sources transform it into
something new—a creature known
as a frost worm.
Remorhaz
A remorhaz is an enormous arctic predator that resembles a multilegged insect
with draconic features. This monster has chitinous plates and more than a score
segmented legs, a multipartite maw, and winglike growths ﬂanking its head. The
most unusual aspect of the creature, however, is its internal heat, which burns
with such intensity that it causes the armored plates on the creature’s back to
become superheated whenever the beast is agitated.
Remorhazes are carnivores. Their diet includes arctic animals such as elk, but
a hungry remorhaz readily devours anything it can catch and kill. It commonly
lurks beneath ice or snow and ambushes prey with a sudden upward strike. Many
victims die before even knowing what attacked them.
Those who survive the worm’s initial onslaught must face not only its deadly
jaws, but also its hideously hot body. This heat can melt weapons, scorch armor, and
burn ﬂesh—all tactics the remorhaz uses to disable and defeat its foes. A remorhaz’s
internal ﬁre allows it to burrow through ice and snow with ease. It leaves smooth
tunnels in its wake as melted ice refreezes to leave the telltale signs of its passage.
Most people underestimate a remorhaz’s intelligence, assuming it to be a mere
animal. However, remorhazes are capable of learning languages. Frost giants in
particular use this trait to form alliances with them. The giants provide food,
protection, and shelter for the worm, and in return the remorhaz acts as a guard
beast and helps the giants build fortresses and forge metal weapons. The giants also
employ the worms as war beasts, using them to undermine enemy positions.

ROC RESOURCES
While most treasure a roc may
possess is incidental—the remains
of prey haphazardly scattered in
or around the nest—roc feathers,
especially white or gold ones, are
highly prized in certain markets.
Even more valuable are roc eggs,
especially to some giants who
enjoy their unique ﬂavor.
Roc
Legendarily massive raptors capable of carrying off elephants as prey, rocs are
typically about 30 feet long from beak to tail and have a wingspan of 80 feet
or more. While their beaks are hooked to rip ﬂesh from bone, their hunting
strategy involves grabbing their prey in their powerful talons and then dropping
it from great heights before feeding. This method creates a massive amount
of carrion, which guarantees that rocs are followed by ﬂocks of opportunistic
scavengers, such as ravens and buzzards, who ﬁnd it easy to steal bits of the
larger birds’ meals. Rocs, for the most part, don’t mind these creatures, which
sometimes get gobbled up along with the rest of the roc’s food.
Rocs usually nest among mountaintops and cliffs inaccessible to all but the
bravest of terrestrial dwellers. They are long-range predators that hunt both
land and sea in search for massive prey to sustain them and their young.
Rocs are antisocial and lone hunters who compete with each other in ﬁerce
aerial battles to protect territory. But about once a decade, a mating couple pairs
up to raise their chicks. Once the chicks are old enough to hunt on their own,
the parents separate to once again engage in lone hunting.
Particularly skilled druids or rangers might capture and train a roc to
serve as a ﬂying mount or hunting companion, though examples of such an
incredible feat of domestication are few and far between. The easiest way to
rear a roc is to do so from the moment it hatches, since the chick imprints
on the ﬁrst creature it sees. Acquiring a roc egg is by no means an easy feat,
though, and is often a death sentence for the would-be egg-snatcher.

ROPER TREASURE
A roper keeps treasure from
its past victims, often enjoying
the items as mementos of prior
conversations or delicious ﬂavors.
In addition, roper gizzards often
collect small trinkets and gems
from those who have been gobbled
whole. Experienced Darklands
adventurers have all sorts of
tall tales of the strange and
unexpected ﬁndings discovered in
a roper gizzard.
Roper
To all but the most sharp-eyed underground explorers, a roper appears to be
nothing more than a large stalactite, stalagmite, or pillar of ice. Cunning and
patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage.
Ropers do not form large societies (although they can often be found living
alongside other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small
clusters and sometimes hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy
of life and death and the ﬁner points of the more cruel and sinister religions
of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought
merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper’s
appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers
do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of
particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or
even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the
end, if such pets don’t eventually escape, the ropers’ appetites win out over their
intellectual curiosity—especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver
their keepers’ wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.

Extend Strands Ȱɵ The roper extends or retracts six thin, sticky tendrils
from its body. While the strands are extended, the roper takes a
–4 circumstance penalty to Stealth checks, and while they’re
retracted, it can’t use its strand Strikes.
Flurry of Strands Ȱɵ The roper makes a strand Strike with
each of its strands (except those that are immobilizing
creatures). Each attack must be against a diﬀerent
target. These attacks count toward the roper’s multiple
attack penalty, but its multiple attack penalty doesn’t
increase until after all the attacks.
Pull the Strands ʚʖ The roper pulls every creature
grabbed by its strands toward itself. The roper rolls
a single Athletics check and compares the result to each immobilized
creature’s Fortitude DC. The roper pulls each creature it succeeds against
up to 25 feet closer and each creature it critically succeeds against up to
50 feet closer.
Sticky Strand Any creature hit by a roper’s strand is enfeebled 1 and grabbed. Each
additional hit from a strand increases the enfeebled condition value by 1 (to a maximum
of enfeebled 4). This enfeebled value decreases by 1 every 8 hours. The roper can move
while it has a creature grabbed with a strand, but it automatically releases the creature
if it moves beyond the strand’s reach. The roper can release an grabbed creature as a
free action. A creature can sever a strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals
at least 18 slashing damage. This doesn’t deal any damage to the roper itself, though it
can no longer attack with a severed strand.

FEARED AND LOATHED
Very few monsters are as hated
by seasoned adventurers as rust
monsters, for these creatures are
not content to merely kill those
who intrude upon their lairs—they
eat their hard-won weapons
and armor! Many innovative
dungeon-dwelling creatures
have seized upon this fact, and
those that can’t arrange for a
rust monster guardian to scare
adventurers away leave rusted bits
of armor with curious markings
strewn about, hoping that the
mere sight of potential rust
monster activity is enough to turn
back would-be troublemakers.
Rust Monster
Found in lost dungeons, deep caves, and abandoned mines, rust monsters are
a bane to any adventurers who rely on armor, weapons, or other metal items.
These strange-looking creatures grow to about 5 feet long, with four insectile legs
and a long tail ending in a four-pronged appendage resembling a tiny windmill.
However, it is the rust monster’s feathery antennae that strike fear in the hearts
of battle-hardened warriors, for a single touch from even just one antenna can
reduce an adventurer’s most valuable tools to a useless pile of rust.
Rust monsters aren’t inherently aggressive creatures, but they’re voracious
oxidivores, meaning they consume the rust created by their antennae. The
creatures savagely attack anything that gets between them and a possible meal,
and they relentlessly pursue any source of metal. A rust monster can be distracted
by a single metal-rich item, but they are often encountered in groups of three or
more, sharply raising the cost of escape.
Rust monsters are a terrible scourge in mining communities. If a group of rust
monsters discovers rich veins of ore, they can multiply quickly. By weakening
tunnels, attacking workers, and consuming the source of the miners’ livelihood,
these aberrations have created many mountainside ghost towns.

bludgeoning plus Improved Knockdown
Antenna Disarm Ȱɵ The rust monster attempts to
Disarm a metal item a creature is holding using
its antenna (with the same modiﬁer as an antenna
Strike). On a success, the item is subject to the
rust monster’s rust ability (see below) in addition
to the eﬀects of the Disarm, and if the check to
Disarm is a critical success, the rust monster drops
the item on the ground in its own space.
Rust A rust monster’s antenna causes metal to rapidly
rust and corrode. If it succeeds at an antenna
Strike or Disarm attempt with its antenna, the
rust monster deals 2d6 damage (doubled
on a critical hit) to a metal item the target
is wearing or holding, ignoring its
Hardness. If the rust monster
hits
an
unattended
metal
item, the item takes this damage
automatically. If a creature uses the Shield Block reaction
with a metal shield against an antenna attack, the shield is automatically broken, but
no other item is rusted on that attack.

SATYR MUSIC
A satyr’s gear is valuable,
particularly his ﬁne panpipes.
Satyrs often stow caches of
alcohol, rich food, and pieces of
ﬁne art (especially erotic art) in
hollows and glades they frequent.
Depending on the type of music
they prefer to play, satyrs may
be able to cast diﬀerent 4th-level
enchantment spells, such as
paranoia or hideous laughter.
Satyr
To a satyr, life is a party and everyone is invited. Notorious for their hedonism,
these fey believe there’s no greater beauty than can be found in song, drink,
indulgent meals, and carnal pleasures. Satyrs use their enchanting songs and
natural charm to encourage all manner of people to follow their true desires and
free themselves from society’s rules. This usually involves enticing mortals to join
raucous parties or engage in trysts in moonlit glades. If a potential companion
rejects a satyr’s advances, however, the satyr has little interest in continuing a
conversation and goes off to ﬁnd more amenable revelers.
The lifestyle of a satyr leaves no room for ongoing affairs or long-term friends.
Once his party is over or his lust is satiated, the satyr disappears back into the
forest. The offspring satyrs leave behind are satyrs themselves, and usually end up
being taken from their cradles by other fey rather than being left in mortals’ care.
Satyrs are always male.
The untouched beauty of the forest is sacred and precious to a satyr. Brutish
intruders who clear-cut trees or massacre animals without eating them risk
drawing a satyr’s ire. A satyr so provoked uses his spells to undermine foes and
attempts to dispatch them either with brutal ambushes or by leading a rush of
forest animals to attack.
Other fey, particularly good fey, look upon satyrs as loutish, embarrassing
cousins. They’re rarely hostile toward satyrs, but most ﬁnd them insufferable and
advise any mortals they like to steer clear of satyrs’ glades.

sleep, or suggestion without expending the spell slot and using his music in place of
providing the spell’s component actions. The spell gains the auditory trait and targets
all creatures in a 60-foot emanation instead of its usual targets. A creature that
succeeds at its Will save against any spell is then temporarily immune from spells
played from that satyr’s pipes for 1 minute. Satyrs are immune to this music.
