Bestiary
Angel
The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs
based on their abilities and purviews. The majority of angels are neutral good and
live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. However, some angels,
including several angelic deities, have different alignments, and some even dwell
on other planes. Regardless of alignment, angels remain benevolent messengers
possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.
Cassisian (Archive Angel)
The weakest of angels, cassisians usually serve as lackey messengers for more
powerful angels or as spiritual guides for mortals. Despite their limited intellect,
cassisians have a knack for precise recollection, particularly with scripture. Most
cassisians are formed from the souls of trustworthy mortals, but some arise from
fragments of greater angels destroyed in service to the celestial realms.

HP 20; Weaknesses evil 3; Resistances cold 3, ﬁre 3
Transfer Protection A non-evil creature can wear a
willing cassisian as a helmet. While it does, the cassisian
can take no actions, but the cassisian extends its +1
status bonus to AC and saves against evil creatures to its
wearer. At any time, the cassisian can detach itself from
its wearer as an action.
Speed ﬂy 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ headbutt +6 (agile, ﬁnesse, good, magical),
Damage 1d6–1 bludgeoning plus 1d4 good
Divine Innate Spells DC 16; 4th read omens; 1st detect alignment

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation)
A cassisian can take the appearance of a dove, a winged humanoid,
a dog, or a ﬁsh. Normally, this doesn’t change its Speed or the attack
and damage bonuses for its Strikes, but it might change the damage
type Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). Any further changes for
speciﬁc forms are noted below.
• Dog size Small; scent (imprecise) 30 feet, Speed 40 feet; Melee jaws +7,
Damage 1d6+2 piercing plus Knockdown
• Fish swim Speed 30 feet
Eye Beams ʚʖ (concentrate, divine, evocation) The cassisian releases beams of heat
or cold from its eyes, dealing 2d6 cold or ﬁre damage (DC 17 basic Reﬂex save) to all
creatures in a 15-foot line. It can’t use Eye Beams again for 1d4 rounds.
Repository of Lore While the cassisian isn’t particularly intelligent, it has perfect memory
and can remember everything it sees or hears. This allows it to attempt Lore checks
on any topic, provided (at the GM’s discretion) the cassisian has encountered the topic
in question before. The cassisian’s limited intellect often prevents it from acting upon
its knowledge, making it a better resource than agent in matters of information use.
Choral (Choir Angel)
Choral angels are incredible singers who ﬁll the halls of Nirvana with pious
chants and sacred hymns. They form from the souls of talented bards and other
performers. While they shy away from conﬂict, they occasionally brave the mortal
ANGELIC DIVINITIES
The most powerful angels belong
to a category of demigods known
as the empyreal lords—a title
shared with other powerful
good-aligned demigods among
the host of archons, azatas, and
other inhabitants of the celestial
planes. The most powerful and
most well-known of the angelic
empyreal lords is Sarenrae.

Harmonize Ȱɵ The choral angel adds
its harmony to a choral angel ally
within its harmonizing aura. The ally
can cast calm emotions or heroism on
its next turn in place of its 3rd-level
sound burst or heighten its 3rd-level sound burst
by 1 level. If ﬁve diﬀerent choral angels use
Harmonize on the same choral angel ally, it
can instead cast divine decree in place of
its 3rd-level sound burst.
Balisse (Confessor Angel)
Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist
mortals ensnared by moral dilemmas or
crises of faith. Balisses prefer to guide people
to their own decisions rather than demand
obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief
is even more powerful than blind obedience.
While most balisses are fundamentally honest,
they use their guardian angel ability to seem less
intimidating and decrease the chance the mortal
will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously
divine being. Balisses often form from souls of those who
performed evil acts but were redeemed. Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but
they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as well.
ANGELIC LOCATIONS
Angels normally live on Nirvana
or other celestial planes, but their
missions can bring them to the
Material Plane. Spellcasters can
conjure them for aid or advice
in times of need, and they can
even be found, if rarely, crusading
against ﬁends in Hell, the Abyss,
or anywhere in between.

# CAVE BEAR

Mauler The grizzly bear gains a +2 circumstance bonus to damage rolls against creatures
it has grabbed.
Rush ʚʖ The grizzly bear Strides and makes a Strike at the end of that movement.
During the Stride, the grizzly bear gains a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed.
Cave Bear
Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins, the cave
bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in
remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in
natural caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is ﬁercely territorial.
Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will
make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its
prey’s soft ﬂesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often
regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remote-dwelling people,
while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants—stone
giants in particular have an afﬁnity for keeping trained cave bears as
pets or guardians for their homes.

BEAR RESOURCES
A bear den can contain valuable
treasures, such as the remains of
less fortunate adventurers who
stumbled into a hungry bear’s
path. Bear furs themselves are
valued as rugs, while their claws
and fangs make for impressive
jewelry or adornments for armor.
Bear hide is an excellent resource
for hide armor.

BEETLE TREASURES
Beetles do not collect treasure,
but the two light-producing
organs of a ﬂash beetle can be
recovered from the creature
and used for illumination-based
chemical recipes, spell
components, and magic
item creation.
BEETLE SPECIES
Numerous other species of giant
beetle exist in the wilds. Duergars
train deep-dwelling beetles as
mounts and guardians. Bombardier
beetles can spew caustic acid as
a potent attack. And the truly
immense goliath beetles can
devastate entire buildings or even
castles with frightening ease.
Beetle
Not all beetles are harmless creatures that can be easily crushed underfoot.
Oversized and ravenous giant beetles can be found throughout the temperate
and tropical regions of the world. They are often benign creatures, though when
threatened or roused, giant beetles are quite dangerous. Their powerful mandibles
and tough exoskeletons make for a challenging combatant.
Flash Beetle
These 3-foot-long insects boast a pair of glowing organs on the back of the
abdomen that give off bright light and that continue to glow for days, even after
the creature’s death. Flash beetles are commonly herded and harvested by miners
and spelunkers, as their glow is considered safer than torches and less expensive
than lamps. Denizens of the Darklands often domesticate and train these insects,
using them as pets, livestock, or caging them to use as organic sources of light in
areas frequented by visitors unaccustomed to the darkness.

area with bright light.
Speed 20 feet, ﬂy 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ mandibles +8 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 1d4+1 piercing
Light Flash Ȱɵ (concentrate, light) The ﬂash beetle creates a brilliant ﬂash of
light. All creatures in its luminescent aura must succeed at a DC 17
Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 minute. The ﬂash beetle’s glow
then goes out, disabling its aura for 24 hours, during which
time it cannot use Light Flash.
Giant Stag Beetle
The giant stag beetle is larger than a horse, and the sight of
one ﬂying (if slowly and somewhat clumsily) on great buzzing
wings is unnerving. Its enormous mandibles are used to impress
mates, intimidate rivals, and discourage predators, for they can
deliver deadly blows. While giant stag beetles are deadly predators,
they can be domesticated by skilled wranglers. In such a capacity, these
beetles serve well as beasts of burden or even as mounts.
Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes,
and heavy forests. More than one logging camp has attracted a cluster
of giant stag beetles and had to be completely abandoned, yielding
all its lumber to the hunger of the giant insects.

CALIGNI TREASURE
Many calignis hide shiny
baubles and trinkets beneath
their dark rags, keeping them
out of sight of their greedy kin.
They also keep several doses of
black smear poison on hand to
incapacitate foes.
Caligni
Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, creeping to the surface to steal, stalk, or make
mischief. Each caligni serves in a speciﬁc role and grows into a speciﬁc form as
determined by supernatural traditions and inﬂuences in caligni society. Regardless
of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale ﬂesh and white eyes. Some
surface dwellers call the caligni “dark folk,” a term they dislike because it doesn’t
reﬂect either their appearance or character, only their environment.
Caligni Dancer
Caligni dancers serve as intermediaries between caligni clans.

THE CALIGNI LEGACY
The calignis are descendants
of humans who, millennia ago,
ﬂed underground to escape a
devastating cataclysm and begged
malevolent, shadowy demigods
known only as the Forsaken for
salvation. The Forsaken warped the
refugees into tough survivors, but
at a price: every caligni that dies
combusts in a burst of energy that
provides a scrap of soul energy to
the Forsaken. The greatest irony
of the caligni’s bargain is that the
Forsaken themselves mysteriously
vanished long ago and no longer
answer pleas or prayers. Today,
caligni still burst into light upon
death, but their soul energy
no longer feeds a mysterious
pantheon of shadowy divinities.
Death Flash (light) When the caligni creeper dies, their body combusts in a ﬂash of bright
light. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or
be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Creatures with light blindness who successfully save are
still blinded for 1 round. The creeper’s gear and treasure are left in a pile where they
died. As this isn’t a magical eﬀect, the light has no eﬀect within magical darkness.

Bestiary
Catfolk
Lithe and agile, with catlike features and long tails, the amurruns are wanderers,
explorers, and extroverts who share a gregarious nature and an unbridled
curiosity. This latter characteristic leads many individual amurruns into trouble,
yet this inquisitiveness is paired with a penchant for good fortune that offsets
much of their self-induced peril. They accept the term “catfolk” as a name for
their people with grace and a hint of amusement.
Ever eager to explore and learn, catfolk have spread to other parts of the world
from their native nations in the southern tropics, yet never in large groups. A lone
catfolk can be found anywhere in the world, but it’s rare to ﬁnd a settlement beyond
their traditional national borders. This is due to their innate wanderlust and insatiable
wonder. As many a catfolk might say, “I’ve lived with my people my whole life, but
you? You’re new and different! There’s so much to learn from you!”
Longstanding amurrun legends claim the catfolk were ﬁrst created as guardians
and were then charged with protecting the world from those sinister forces
that exist at its fringes. Often, this charge manifests as a longstanding
opposition to cultists of demon lords, archdevils, and other
ﬁendish demigods. Many catfolk worship the spirits
of creation, using serendipitous rituals to attract
good fortune and banish ill luck in the spirits’
name, while others venerate their own
small pantheon of divinities. Those who
travel often ﬁnd comfort in the worship
of Desna, whose teachings closely match
their own predilections.
Catfolk adapt well to adventuring roles,
and can be quite diverse in their areas
of study and specialization. Those who
follow the traditions of rangers and rogues are
perhaps the most commonly encountered, but not
overwhelmingly so. Their natural curiosity leads some
catfolk to take up mystical arts, training as wizards or following
a divine path to become clerics.

southern Garund. It is a nation
rumored to hold a dark secret at
its center, the details of which
its discreet inhabitants do not
willingly divulge to outsiders.
Indeed, few adventurers from the

to gain entrance to Murraseth, let
alone discover any of its mysteries.

Cauthooj
These large, ﬂightless birds are deceptively agile, considering their long bodies and
awkward, hopping gait. Solitary predators, they use their hypnotic warbling song
to drive prey into a wild frenzy, manipulating them into attacking one another so
that the cauthooj can then feast on the remains.
Known to some scholars as the puppet master bird, and to others as the shrill
shrike, cauthoojs are widely reviled by most intelligent humanoids, in part because
the birds seem to prefer humanoids to other prey. Cauthooj sightings typically
lead to the creation of hunting parties to track the creature down before it can kill
again, with would-be hunters typically stufﬁng their ears full of wax in an effort
to avoid being affected by its cry. Those who have survived the creature’s song
report that the experience is uniquely unnerving, and almost all accounts agree
that there is no other sound as terrible.
While one might assume the cauthooj is a dumb animal, these creatures are in fact
quite a bit smarter than they look. Cauthoojs stalk the perimeter of remote settlements
in hopes of ﬁnding a lone traveler they can feast upon. These patient creatures will wait
in ambush as long as they must to sate their hunger. They
can even understand a few rudimentary words in Sylvan,
although they are incapable of clearly speaking themselves.
This doesn’t stop the cauthooj from attempting to mimic
the sounds it hears, but when it does so, its eerie primal
nature enhances the attempt, leading to the bird’s signature ability
to manipulate minds and encourage conﬂict, a trait the cauthooj is just
barely smart enough to understand—and enjoy.

Critical Failure The target is confused for 1 round and immediately attacks itself (in

CAUTHOOJ TREASURE
Like magpies, cauthoojs are
attracted to shiny baubles, and
they often pick up choice treasures
from their victims, depositing
these trinkets in large piles in their
lairs. Not all that glitters is gold,
however, and adventurers will ﬁnd
as many colorful bits of string,
broken mirror shards, and pieces
of costume jewelry as they ﬁnd
coins, magic weapons, and other
valuable treasures.
CAUTHOOJ LOCATIONS
Cauthoojs make their lairs in
small caverns, alcoves, and similar
out-of-the-way places, but claim
large stretches of territory and
wander many miles from their lairs
in search of food. They often hunt
in plains, prairies, and other large,
open expanses.

Cave Worm
Cave worms are gigantic scavengers that bore through the depths of the world,
eating whatever material they ﬁnd. Named for their distinctive colorations, these
worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms
of different colors and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales
speak of white worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and gray
worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.
Purple Worm
The purple worm is the most common and infamous of the cave worms, a
much‑feared monster wandering the twisting tunnels of the Darklands that is capable
of carving out entire cave systems. Tunnels bored by a purple worm don’t always last
long after these creature’s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening mazes
of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to ﬁnd the worm’s
central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm’s prior victims.

CAVE WORM GUARDIANS
Cave worms are notoriously dim

animalistic needs to feed and
reproduce. This hasn’t prevented
attempts to use them as guardians
for their lairs, if not to tame them.
Magic can be used to maintain
control over a worm, but gifted,
patient, and brave animal trainers
can condition cave worms to
serve in all manner of roles, such
as living siege engines, shocking
methods of executing foes, or
merely pets.

CENTAUR TREASURE
Centaurs appreciate ﬁne weapons
and armor. Some craft their own
while others use quality armaments
they take from their enemies;
however, due to their forms, they
are unlikely to use armor heavier
than breastplates.
Centaur
Centaurs are legendary hunters and trackers who resemble heavily muscled
humans with the bodies of powerful horses from the waist down. They are
typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques
and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged
folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and
humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty
nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take
kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which
have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature
who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their ﬁnely
honed hunting skills to inﬂict deadly wounds.
Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of
centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an
earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances
with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such
allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs’ honor,
pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe
to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily
integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are
quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and
thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.
Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual
size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly
similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower
bodies—like those of horses—can vary widely from
parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall
and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.
Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members,
usually led by an old, powerful seer or battlehardened warrior who has carried out many noble
deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their
comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of
their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the
tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the
ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior
might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid
settlements and even rival centaur groups.

CENTIPEDE SPECIES
Centipedes take nearly countless
forms amid nearly every climate,
with speciﬁc traits and abilities
varying wildly between species.
Tangled forests, arid deserts,
foul sewers, deep caverns, and
abandoned buildings are all
common haunts for centipedes,
from oversized specimens capable
of taking down signiﬁcant prey
alone to carpets of frenzied vermin
gathered into a dangerous swarm.
Larger and more specialized
centipedes than the two presented
here exist, such as the sleek giant
whiptail centipede or the immense
titan centipede.
Centipede
Hunters and scavengers that live amid dung and detritus, centipedes are a
relatively common and often reviled threat faced by adventurers. Scurrying about
with surprising speed on the scores of legs attached to their long, segmented
bodies, centipedes strike with poisoned mandibles to slow and torment their prey
with a vicious toxin before they settle down to feed in slow and disgusting leisure.
Giant Centipede
Most giant centipedes (known as sewer centipedes when found in cities) nest in
small groups but hunt alone when they seek out food. Attempts to domesticate
giant centipedes for use as guardians or pets generally end poorly, but some
tribes of goblins, kobolds, and mitﬂits have developed effective methods of
utilizing these vermin as guardians. Other tribes and some humanoid societies
roast and eat centipedes, often with pungent peppers as a savory delicacy,
although care must be taken in preparing the meal to avoid tainting the ﬂesh
with the creature’s venom.

some mutagens, claiming such infusions increase potency, though other say this

CHANGELING EXILES
Changelings who resist the Call and
abandon the society that raised
them become exiles like the one
presented on this page—creatures
who live solitary lives in the wild
and are often driven to desperate
measures to survive, taking up the
lifestyles of highway bandits or
risk-taking wilderness guides.

Changeling
Children of hags, destined to become hags themselves, changelings face a life of conﬂict.
Born of supernatural creatures who kill and consume the child’s father, changelings are
deposited into their father’s society to be raised. These offspring appear to be members
of their paternal ancestry, and changelings have been found among dwarves, gnomes,
orcs, goblins, and numerous others, but human-ancestry changelings are by far the
most common. Within the normal range for their ancestry, changelings tend toward
slighter builds, darker hair, and pale complexions, though their
most common feature is a nearly universal heterochromia,
leading to widespread superstition about individuals with
differently colored eyes.
As changelings come of age, they sometimes manifest
abilities granted by their hag heritage. Some gain the
ability to see in the dark, some grow ﬁngernails long and
hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger
abilities speciﬁc to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays,
the children of night hags or their cousins the dreamthief hags,
can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and
sleep. Other types of changelings include slag mays, the children
of annis hags; callow mays, the children of green hags; brine
mays, the children of sea hags; and others for each type of hag.
As beings infused with supernatural power, changelings ﬁnd
themselves able to command various traditions of magic, with
many drawn to either the occult magic common among hags or
primal magic.
At roughly the same time in their lives, many changelings—
women in particular—begin to hear the Call, a psychic urging from
their hag mother luring them away from the communities that raised
them. If followed, the Call eventually leads the changeling to the hag’s
coven, where they are subjected to terrible rituals that twist them
into hags themselves. Some changelings, especially those who have
strong social bonds or embrace druidic traditions, are able to resist
this Call and continue on with their mortal lives. The fact that the Call
disproportionately targets female changelings has led to a widespread
misunderstanding that all changelings are female, while in fact male
changelings are simply assumed to be members of their paternal ancestry.

This changeling exile is the child of a night hag or dreamthief hag.

KOBOLD ADORATION
Some kobold groups are fond of
chimera guardians or pets, but
few kobolds have the bravery or
resources to keep a chimera happy
for long. While chimeras are often
pressed into service by more
intelligent creatures, it’s also not
unheard of for a chimera to keep
a herd of unintelligent animals—
lions, goats, or even serpents—as
both companions and food supply.
Chimera
The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up of a
monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion, a
dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it sees,
but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve as a
guardian or even a mount.

CHUUL TREASURE
While chuuls are uninterested
in money, gems, tools, or magic
of any kind, they have a nearly
compulsive need to collect trophies
of their victories, perchance to
savor the memories of the kill and
the meat. What treasure they have
are typically such mementos.
Chuul
Also known as chu’ulothis, these large, armor-plated, crustacean predators lurk
beneath the surface of pools, mires, and ponds, waiting to snatch up prey with
their massive claws before paralyzing them with their tentacles. At that point,
they begin to feed, eating their quarry alive.
Chuuls can live in fresh or saltwater, and indeed are found in aquatic environs
the world over—even in the subterranean oceans and lakes of the Darklands.
While chuuls are good swimmers, they prefer terrestrial prey. Their preferred
method of hunting is by lunging out of the water, paralyzing their victims with
their poison-coated tentacles, then gleefully dragging their twitching food into the
water to drown if they cannot simply eat such morsels alive. Chuuls that dwell
aboveground prefer to dine on lizardfolk, while those swimming the subterranean
lakes of the Darklands readily eat anything but xulgaths, whose ﬂavor and stink
they ﬁnd off-putting.
Chuuls are capable of speech and reason, but these creatures rarely speak with
those outside their species except to taunt their food. Before it begins consuming
its prey, a chuul often speaks in a gurgling, nearly incomprehensible dialect about
how it will enjoy feasting on the creature’s ﬂesh. Perhaps chuuls believe that
insults and degradation lead to more tender and tastier food, but the truth will
likely never be known; almost all chuuls stubbornly refuse any
meaningful conversation, even when imprisoned and compelled
by treats or pain.
It is unknown if a chuul society exists beyond their frenzied
mating season. Chuuls’ intellects seem devoted only toward eating,
causing psychological pain to sentient creatures, decorating their
lairs with mementos of their favorite meals and
victories, and breeding.

CLOAKER ALLIES
On the rare occasions that cloakers
associate with other creatures, they
tend to ally with those ulat‑kinis
(page 12) who are no longer the
thralls of the alghollthus and,
rarely, with deros (pages 84–85),
though they consider the latter
irrational and untrustworthy.
Cloakers never willingly associate
with alghollthus.
CLOAKER LOCATIONS
Cloakers isolate themselves within
the deeper parts of the Darklands
and are concentrated in Sekamina
and Orv. They tend to avoid Nar‑Voth
due to its proximity to the surface.
Cloaker
Weird and paranoid creatures that dwell in the Darklands, cloakers resemble
hideous, ﬂying manta rays. Crafty and careful hunters, their motivations, their
patterns of attack, and even their societies and history are often an inscrutable
jumble of contradicting reports, confused rumors, and terrifying accounts.
Like many of the stranger creatures of Golarion, cloakers were originally created
by the alghollthus, who bred them to spy on their Azlanti thralls. Upon the fall of
the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn,
ﬂed to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of
their new home, their attitudes—particularly regarding their apprehension toward
their former masters—changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism,
sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the
Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia
is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering

# CLOAKER
================================================================================


CLOAKER ALLIES
On the rare occasions that cloakers
associate with other creatures, they
tend to ally with those ulat‑kinis
(page 12) who are no longer the
thralls of the alghollthus and,
rarely, with deros (pages 84–85),
though they consider the latter
irrational and untrustworthy.
Cloakers never willingly associate
with alghollthus.
CLOAKER LOCATIONS
Cloakers isolate themselves within
the deeper parts of the Darklands
and are concentrated in Sekamina
and Orv. They tend to avoid Nar‑Voth
due to its proximity to the surface.
Cloaker
Weird and paranoid creatures that dwell in the Darklands, cloakers resemble
hideous, ﬂying manta rays. Crafty and careful hunters, their motivations, their
patterns of attack, and even their societies and history are often an inscrutable
jumble of contradicting reports, confused rumors, and terrifying accounts.
Like many of the stranger creatures of Golarion, cloakers were originally created
by the alghollthus, who bred them to spy on their Azlanti thralls. Upon the fall of
the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn,
ﬂed to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of
their new home, their attitudes—particularly regarding their apprehension toward
their former masters—changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism,
sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the
Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia
is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering
another cloaker only brieﬂy to mate before ﬂitting back to isolation.
But there are exceptions. Every so often, a charismatic cloaker priest can call
together a dark cabal of these creatures and other Darklands denizens to worship
unspeakable ancient gods. These rare cloakers whip their acolytes and followers
into a frenzy of dark rituals and heinous acts. While these cults are depraved and
destructive, they rarely survive longer than their founder.

Envelop Ȱɵ (attack, incapacitation) The cloaker makes an attack roll with
a +14 bonus against an adjacent creature’s Reﬂex DC. If it succeeds, it
envelops the target, who is restrained. Attacks that hit an enveloping
cloaker deal half their damage to the cloaker and half to the trapped

COCKATRICE TREASURE
Cockatrice lairs sometimes include
discarded gear from past victims
or smooth, pretty stones disgorged
from the creature’s craw. Gem
workers especially prize precious
stones that have been polished to
perfection in a cockatrice’s crop,
and may pay a high price for these
so-called "cockatrice rocks." Soft
materials suitable for nesting, such
as cloth and leather, rarely survive
a cockatrice’s attentions, but metal
goods are often left in ﬁne working
order, since cockatrices seem to
have little interest in anything
shiny they can’t ﬁt in their gullet.
Cockatrice
Ugly and aggressive, the dread cockatrice stalks garbage pits and hillside dumps in
search of prey that it can turn to stone with its petrifying beak and subsequently
consume piece by broken piece. Cockatrices resemble gaunt and sickly roosters
with bat wings and serpentine tails, and they rarely grow more than 2 feet tall
and twice as long. Their absentminded clucking gives smart prey ample warning
of their presence, and when angered cockatrices let out a shrill crow like that
of a rooster. Their peck releases a magical toxin that causes ﬂesh to quickly
calcify, and any creature pecked repeatedly by an irritable cockatrice eventually
transforms into a stone statue of itself.
The ﬁrst cockatrice is rumored to have hatched from a rooster’s egg incubated
on a dung hill by a toad. Whether or not the rumor is true, the cockatrice’s
monstrous appearance certainly doesn’t contradict its strange and ﬁlthy origin
story, and these creatures are more than capable of propagating on their own.
Cockatrices are remarkably fecund and gather in ﬂocks of up to a dozen
members. Each ﬂock contains only a few females. The males—which differ in
appearance from the females by having warty wattles and gnarled combs—
often ﬁght with each other, with lower-ranking males eventually driven away
to ﬁnd their own lairs or compete among other ﬂocks. Most creatures who run
afoul of a solitary cockatrice do so with one of these surly outcasts.
Cockatrice lairs are often littered with fragments of statuary from past
victims—although these are as likely to be remnants of frogs, lizards, and insects
as people. Curiously, weasels and ferrets, who inﬁltrate cockatrice lairs to steal
their eggs, are immune to the creatures’ petrifying bites. For unknown reasons,
cockatrices are both terriﬁed of and enraged by conventional roosters, and they
are equally likely to ﬂee or attack when confronted by one.
Particularly brave (or foolhardy) individuals sometimes keep cockatrices as pets
or guard animals. In their natural habitat among plains, forests, and sewers near
humanoid settlements, cockatrices are content to live off vermin or scraps of waste,
but their greatest pleasure is consuming warm meals of freshly petriﬁed ﬂesh.

Calciﬁcation (incapacitation, primal, transmutation)
A peck from a cockatrice hardens the ﬂesh
of the creature struck. The target must
succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or
become slowed 1 (or slowed 2 on a
critical failure). Further failed saves
against calciﬁcation increase the slowed
condition. Once a creature’s actions
are reduced to 0 by calciﬁcation, that
creature becomes petriﬁed.
Every 24 hours after it was petriﬁed,
the victim can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude
save to recover. On a success, it becomes ﬂesh again, but is slowed 1 for the next
24 hours. On a critical success, the creature recovers and isn’t slowed. On a failure,
the creature remains petriﬁed, but can try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure,
the petriﬁcation is permanent, and the creature can’t attempt any more saves.

CROCODILE RESOURCES
A crocodile’s skin can be used as
leather, and its meat is chewy and
mild, though even a large crocodile
doesn’t usually yield more than 50
pounds of usable meat.
CROCODILE LOCATIONS
Crocodiles often live in warm,
tropical areas, either in fresh or salt
water. Alligators are found in more
varied climates, but only in fresh
water. Deinosuchuses, particularly
the largest and most dangerous of
their kind, prefer estuaries, bays,
or other brackish bodies of water
connected to both river and sea.
Crocodile
Powerful and primeval in appearance, crocodiles are dangerous natural predators
that dwell in marshes, riverbeds, swamps, and other wetlands.
Crocodile
Crocodiles can be found basking on riverbanks, lurking in swamps, or ﬂoating
in lakes. They are usually are indistinguishable from logs when viewed from
afar—at least until they attack. Alligators have similar statistics, but because
they often live in more temperate climates, they endure cold temperatures
better. Unlike alligators, crocodiles can tolerate salt water. Both are formidable
predators that are likely to devour careless adventurers who fail to watch where
they step.

CYCLOPS SEERS
Great cyclopes are traditionally
violent creatures, but some retain
fragments of the old ways that lull
them into periods of calm. During
such times, they can be incredible
sources of information, but one
must take care to be well away
from the great cyclops’s lair before
its bestial rage wakens once more.
Ranged Ȱɵ heavy crossbow +8 (range increment 120 feet, reload 2), Damage 1d10+4 piercing
Swipe ʚʖ (ﬂourish) The cyclops makes a melee Strike and compares the attack roll
result to the AC of up to two foes, each of whom must be within its melee reach and
adjacent to each other. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature hit. A
Swipe counts as two attacks for the cyclops’s multiple attack penalty.
Great Cyclops
Gigantic, dim-witted loners, the great cyclopes embody their lesser kin writ
large. They are both stronger and more violent, but their uncontrolled vision
into possible futures has driven them beyond reason. They see every moment
as a potential storm of uncontrollable fury, and out of a desperate desire for
peace, quiet, and an end to their hunger, they lash out at all who come near. Wise
creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost.
Debate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They
are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by
their lesser kin, but they are now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other
scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species.
Whatever foolish decision or wayward curse caused the end of their civilization
is still playing out, occasionally causing a cyclops to withdraw from its own kind,
lose all semblance of intellect, and mutate into a lumbering, feral colossus. It
is fortunate indeed that the great cyclops prefers to dwell far from humanoid
settlements, because its immeasurable bloodlust inspires it to destroy virtually
anything that moves, from dinosaurs and other monsters to the occasional
explorer or soon-to-be-lost caravan.

# CACODAEMON
================================================================================


Bestiary
Daemon
Denizens of the bleak and terrible plane of Abaddon, daemons are shaped by and
devoted to the destruction of life in all its forms. They seek the death of every mortal
being by the most painful and horrible means possible, all in service to the apocalyptic
entities known as the Four Horsemen. Each kind of daemon represents a different
way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular
form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down
into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use
the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons
always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often,
daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other ﬁends, knowing that such
confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all ﬁends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own
numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a
supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least
of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in
other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy,
a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the
greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Cacodaemon (Harvester Daemon)
These embodiments of demented violence and spite are spawned from eddies of
angry and warped souls amid Abaddon’s mists. Cacodaemons constantly hunger
for mortal souls and yearn to create suffering. As gnashing spheres of teeth, ﬁns, and
spines, they are the weakest of daemonkind, an amalgam of various petty forms of
death without the strength that comes from focusing on a single cause of demise.

Numerous powerful and unique
daemon demigods, known
collectively as harbingers, rule
over swaths of Abaddon. Above
these demigods, though, are
entities of even greater power—the

As the eons go on, the names and

Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence),
Charon (Horseman of Death),
Szuriel (Horseman of War),
and Trelmarixian (Horseman of

never fallen to an upstart. Some
hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once
ruled over the other four, while

Cloud Giant
The graceful and regal cloud giants have skin of milky white to powdery blue.
Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are neutral,
but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil. Good cloud
giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and are interested
in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It’s not uncommon for such
giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships
with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist
and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves
and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other
creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate
a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders
often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins.
Legends persist of ﬂoating cities ruled by magically gifted cloud giant
queens and kings. While most cloud giants plainly state that such claims
are pure fantasy, others are mysteriously tight-lipped or evasive about
the matter.

# CLAY GOLEM
================================================================================

Alchemical Injection When an alchemical golem hits a creature with a syringe Strike,
roll 1d6 on the alchemical chambers list to determine the additional eﬀect of the
attack. The syringe deals an additional 2d6 damage of the appropriate type (or
exposes the target to the sickness eﬀect, as appropriate).
Generate Bomb Ȱɵ (manipulate) The golem ﬁlls an empty vial from one of its alchemical
chambers to create a bomb and then makes a bomb Strike. Determine the type of bomb
created by rolling 1d6 on the alchemical chambers list above. On a roll of 1–4, it creates
the corresponding greater alchemical bomb: an acid ﬂask from chamber 1, a frost vial
from chamber 2, bottled lightning from chamber 3, or alchemist’s ﬁre from chamber 4.
On a roll of 5, it creates a poisonous bomb that deals 3d10 poison damage and 3 poison
splash damage with no other eﬀects. On a roll of 6, it creates a sickness bomb, which
exposes the target and all creatures in the splash radius to the sickness eﬀect; creatures
hit by only the splash receive a +2 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude saves.
Clay Golem
Traditionally, clay golems are crafted in the image of a deity and used as
guardians of tombs or sacred crypts. Clay golems have the power to lay curses
upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that
these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While
this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly
around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.
The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable,
making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when
damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a
rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems
are maintained and in good working order—or otherwise place them on the other
side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.

STONE GOLEMS
Depending on the material from
which it is made and the care that
went into crafting it, a destroyed
stone golem may be worth as much
as an immaculately sculpted marble
pillar or as little as a pile of rubble.
Vulnerable to Disintegrate A disintegrate spell aﬀects the golem but deals half the
normal amount of damage and causes the golem to become slowed 2 for 1 round.
Quicken Ȳ˓ (divine, transmutation) Frequency Once per day. Trigger The clay golem’s
turn begins. It can’t trigger this free action on the ﬁrst turn of combat. Eﬀect The clay
golem becomes quickened for 1 minute.
Speed 20 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +24 (magical, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d10+12 bludgeoning plus cursed wound
Berserk Slam Ȱɵ Requirement The golem is berserk. Eﬀect The clay golem Strikes
with its ﬁst at a –1 circumstance penalty. If its Strike hits, the clay golem deals an
additional 1d8 damage and knocks the target prone.
Cursed Wound (divine, curse, necromancy) A creature hit by the clay golem’s ﬁst must
succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be cursed until healed to its maximum HP. The
cursed creature can’t regain HP except via magic, and anyone casting a spell to heal
the creature must succeed at a DC 29 counteract check or the healing has no eﬀect.
The golem’s counteract level is equal to its creature level.
Stone Golem
Stone golems are slow and steady constructs typically carved from marble or
granite. They’re often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem
crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues.
Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or
missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn’t
adversely impact the golems’ functionality.
Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain
ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out
orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much
more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or
higher and never smaller than Huge in size—most are Gargantuan.
Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so
dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause
surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to
buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In
addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems
attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking
down multiple targets at once.

Bestiary
LINNORM KINGS
In the storied Lands of the
Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a
linnorm is traditionally required for
those who would claim a nation’s
crown. Recently, though, the
Linnorm King White Estrid claimed
her crown not by slaying a linnorm
but by beating it into submission,
gaining a powerful and dangerous
ally to help secure her rule.
Linnorm
Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate
those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inﬂict as much suffering as possible
upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be
the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible
strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality.
Crag Linnorm
Despite being among the weakest linnorms, the crag linnorm is a devastating
predator, capable of quickly cooking its foes with its magma breath.

Primal Innate Spells DC 33; Constant (6th) freedom of movement; (5th) true seeing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (evocation, ﬁre, primal) The crag linnorm breathes out a stream
of magma in a 120-foot line that deals 12d6 ﬁre damage to creatures within
the area (DC 34 basic Reﬂex save). Any creature that fails its
save also takes 4d6 persistent ﬁre damage. The crag linnorm
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds. The magma
remains until the start of the linnorm's next turn. If the
linnorm was on the ground, the magma remains as a
burning line on the ground directly under the line of
the Breath Weapon, and if the linnorm was airborne,
the magma rains downward in a sheet 60 feet high.
Any creature that moves across or through the
magma takes 6d6 ﬁre damage (DC 34 basic Reﬂex
save). At the start of the linnorm's next turn,
the magma cools to a thin layer of brittle
stone on the ground, or the magma rain
ﬁnishes falling and turns to harmless
pebbles. The cooled magma quickly
degrades to powder and sand over the
course of several hours.

DEATH CURSES
The death curses of the linnorms
are often the subjects of tragic
sagas, and those who would think
themselves vanquishing heroes
for slaying a linnorm often meet
their dooms soon thereafter,
succumbing to these curses well
after the death of the linnorm
responsible for bestowing it.
Ice Linnorm
The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses, atop wind-blasted mountain peaks,
or within glittering caverns carved from the hearts of the mightiest of icebergs.
