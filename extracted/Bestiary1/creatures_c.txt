Angel
The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs
based on their abilities and purviews. The majority of angels are neutral good and
live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. However, some angels,
including several angelic deities, have different alignments, and some even dwell
on other planes. Regardless of alignment, angels remain benevolent messengers
possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.
Cassisian (Archive Angel)
The weakest of angels, cassisians usually serve as lackey messengers for more
powerful angels or as spiritual guides for mortals. Despite their limited intellect,
cassisians have a knack for precise recollection, particularly with scripture. Most
cassisians are formed from the souls of trustworthy mortals, but some arise from
fragments of greater angels destroyed in service to the celestial realms.

Transfer Protection A non-evil creature can wear a
willing cassisian as a helmet. While it does, the cassisian
can take no actions, but the cassisian extends its +1
status bonus to AC and saves against evil creatures to its
wearer. At any time, the cassisian can detach itself from
its wearer as an action.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation)
A cassisian can take the appearance of a dove, a winged humanoid,
a dog, or a ﬁsh. Normally, this doesn’t change its Speed or the attack
and damage bonuses for its Strikes, but it might change the damage
type Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). Any further changes for
speciﬁc forms are noted below.
• Dog size Small; scent (imprecise) 30 feet, Speed 40 feet; Melee jaws +7,
Damage 1d6+2 piercing plus Knockdown
• Fish swim Speed 30 feet
Eye Beams ʚʖ (concentrate, divine, evocation) The cassisian releases beams of heat
or cold from its eyes, dealing 2d6 cold or ﬁre damage (DC 17 basic Reﬂex save) to all
creatures in a 15-foot line. It can’t use Eye Beams again for 1d4 rounds.
Repository of Lore While the cassisian isn’t particularly intelligent, it has perfect memory
and can remember everything it sees or hears. This allows it to attempt Lore checks
on any topic, provided (at the GM’s discretion) the cassisian has encountered the topic
in question before. The cassisian’s limited intellect often prevents it from acting upon
its knowledge, making it a better resource than agent in matters of information use.
Choral (Choir Angel)
Choral angels are incredible singers who ﬁll the halls of Nirvana with pious
chants and sacred hymns. They form from the souls of talented bards and other
performers. While they shy away from conﬂict, they occasionally brave the mortal
ANGELIC DIVINITIES
The most powerful angels belong
to a category of demigods known
as the empyreal lords—a title
shared with other powerful
good-aligned demigods among
the host of archons, azatas, and
other inhabitants of the celestial
planes. The most powerful and
most well-known of the angelic
empyreal lords is Sarenrae.

Deafening Aria On a critical hit with
piercing hymn, the target is

Harmonize Ȱɵ The choral angel adds
its harmony to a choral angel ally
within its harmonizing aura. The ally
can cast calm emotions or heroism on
its next turn in place of its 3rd-level
sound burst or heighten its 3rd-level sound burst
by 1 level. If ﬁve diﬀerent choral angels use
Harmonize on the same choral angel ally, it
can instead cast divine decree in place of
its 3rd-level sound burst.
Balisse (Confessor Angel)
Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist
mortals ensnared by moral dilemmas or
crises of faith. Balisses prefer to guide people
to their own decisions rather than demand
obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief
is even more powerful than blind obedience.
While most balisses are fundamentally honest,
they use their guardian angel ability to seem less
intimidating and decrease the chance the mortal
will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously
divine being. Balisses often form from souls of those who
performed evil acts but were redeemed. Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but
they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as well.
ANGELIC LOCATIONS
Angels normally live on Nirvana
or other celestial planes, but their
missions can bring them to the
Material Plane. Spellcasters can
conjure them for aid or advice
in times of need, and they can
even be found, if rarely, crusading
against ﬁends in Hell, the Abyss,
or anywhere in between.

Confessor’s Aura (aura, divine, enchantment, mental) 20 feet. Creatures in the balisse’s
aura are subject to zone of truth (DC 23). Additionally, if these creatures choose to
honestly express their own conﬂicted feelings, the aura makes it easier for them to
put words to those feelings.
Speed 30 feet, ﬂy 40 feet

Brand of the Impenitent ʚʖ (curse, divine, evocation)
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect The balisse marks
an evil creature within its confessor’s aura as
irredeemable. It can only do so after a failed
attempt to convince the creature to repent. The
touched creature takes a –1 status penalty to AC
and saves, reduces its resistances by 2, and gains
weakness 2 to good damage. The duration depends on
the target’s DC 26 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The duration is 1 round.
Failure The duration is 1 day.
Critical Failure The duration is permanent.
Flaming Armament (divine, evocation) Any
weapon gains the eﬀect of a ﬂaming property
rune while a balisse wields it.
Guiding Angel Ȱɵ (divine, transmutation)
While invisible, a balisse can spiritually
attach itself to a non-evil mortal. When it
does so, it merges with the mortal’s body and
is unable to use any of its spells and abilities
other than to interact with the mortal. It must
use Guiding Angel again to leave the mortal. While
merged with the mortal, the balisse can take a form
of its choice that only the mortal can see, such as a
small angel on the mortal’s shoulder. Alternatively, it
can communicate with the mortal using a bodiless
voice only the mortal can hear.
Astral Deva (Emissary Angel)
Astral devas are the elite messengers and
emissaries of the celestial realms, serving
deities and celestial armies by delivering messages,
performing reconnaissance, and providing support for
those in need of aid. They watch over planar
travelers and take powerful mortals under
ANGELIC TREASURE
Many angels wear exquisite
armor or wield beautiful and often
magical weapons. While they are
not hampered by mortal sins like
greed or pride (save for the very
rare and tragic exception), they do
enjoy the beauty of ﬁne clothing,
exquisite jewelry, and works of art.

BEETLE TREASURES
Beetles do not collect treasure,
but the two light-producing
organs of a ﬂash beetle can be
recovered from the creature
and used for illumination-based
chemical recipes, spell
components, and magic
item creation.
BEETLE SPECIES
Numerous other species of giant
beetle exist in the wilds. Duergars
train deep-dwelling beetles as
mounts and guardians. Bombardier
beetles can spew caustic acid as
a potent attack. And the truly
immense goliath beetles can
devastate entire buildings or even
castles with frightening ease.
Beetle
Not all beetles are harmless creatures that can be easily crushed underfoot.
Oversized and ravenous giant beetles can be found throughout the temperate
and tropical regions of the world. They are often benign creatures, though when
threatened or roused, giant beetles are quite dangerous. Their powerful mandibles
and tough exoskeletons make for a challenging combatant.
Flash Beetle
These 3-foot-long insects boast a pair of glowing organs on the back of the
abdomen that give off bright light and that continue to glow for days, even after
the creature’s death. Flash beetles are commonly herded and harvested by miners
and spelunkers, as their glow is considered safer than torches and less expensive
than lamps. Denizens of the Darklands often domesticate and train these insects,
using them as pets, livestock, or caging them to use as organic sources of light in
areas frequented by visitors unaccustomed to the darkness.

Melee Ȱɵ mandibles +8 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 1d4+1 piercing
Light Flash Ȱɵ (concentrate, light) The ﬂash beetle creates a brilliant ﬂash of
light. All creatures in its luminescent aura must succeed at a DC 17
Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 minute. The ﬂash beetle’s glow
then goes out, disabling its aura for 24 hours, during which
time it cannot use Light Flash.
Giant Stag Beetle
The giant stag beetle is larger than a horse, and the sight of
one ﬂying (if slowly and somewhat clumsily) on great buzzing
wings is unnerving. Its enormous mandibles are used to impress
mates, intimidate rivals, and discourage predators, for they can
deliver deadly blows. While giant stag beetles are deadly predators,
they can be domesticated by skilled wranglers. In such a capacity, these
beetles serve well as beasts of burden or even as mounts.
Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes,
and heavy forests. More than one logging camp has attracted a cluster
of giant stag beetles and had to be completely abandoned, yielding
all its lumber to the hunger of the giant insects.

THE CALIGNI LEGACY
The calignis are descendants
of humans who, millennia ago,
ﬂed underground to escape a
devastating cataclysm and begged
malevolent, shadowy demigods
known only as the Forsaken for
salvation. The Forsaken warped the
refugees into tough survivors, but
at a price: every caligni that dies
combusts in a burst of energy that
provides a scrap of soul energy to
the Forsaken. The greatest irony
of the caligni’s bargain is that the
Forsaken themselves mysteriously
vanished long ago and no longer
answer pleas or prayers. Today,
caligni still burst into light upon
death, but their soul energy
no longer feeds a mysterious
pantheon of shadowy divinities.
Death Flash (light) When the caligni creeper dies, their body combusts in a ﬂash of bright
light. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or
be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Creatures with light blindness who successfully save are
still blinded for 1 round. The creeper’s gear and treasure are left in a pile where they
died. As this isn’t a magical eﬀect, the light has no eﬀect within magical darkness.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ dagger +10 (agile, ﬁnesse, versatile S), Damage 1d4+4 piercing plus black

Ranged Ȱɵ dagger +10 (agile, thrown 10 feet, versatile S), Damage 1d4 piercing plus black

Double Slice ʚʖ The caligni stalker makes two Strikes
against the same target, one with each of their
shortswords. The stalker combines the damage of
any attacks that hit and applies precision damage,
resistances, and weaknesses only once. Both
attacks count toward the stalker’s multiple
attack penalty, but the penalty increases only after both attacks.
Encircling Command Ȱɵ (auditory) Each caligni creeper within 30 feet of the stalker
can Step. Each creeper can beneﬁt from Encircling Command only once per round.

Lion
Lions are cooperative hunters, ambushing dangerous prey in groups of lionesses

DOMESTICATING BIG CATS
While it’s common practice to keep
a house cat in the home to ward
oﬀ unwanted rodents, keeping
a big cat for a pet is a diﬀerent
matter entirely. Nevertheless,
up-and-coming merchant lords,
impetuous princes and princesses,
and status-obsessed nobles
have tried to do just that, often
resulting only in terriﬁed house
staﬀ and ruined upholstery. Many
among the idle rich will gladly pay
for the services of an unscrupulous
druid or ranger who promises to
help them achieve their dreams
of an oversized feline friend, but
the dire risks of such an endeavor
are enough to dissuade even the
greediest would-be animal trainers
from even attempting the feat.

Cauthooj
These large, ﬂightless birds are deceptively agile, considering their long bodies and
awkward, hopping gait. Solitary predators, they use their hypnotic warbling song
to drive prey into a wild frenzy, manipulating them into attacking one another so
that the cauthooj can then feast on the remains.
Known to some scholars as the puppet master bird, and to others as the shrill
shrike, cauthoojs are widely reviled by most intelligent humanoids, in part because
the birds seem to prefer humanoids to other prey. Cauthooj sightings typically
lead to the creation of hunting parties to track the creature down before it can kill
again, with would-be hunters typically stufﬁng their ears full of wax in an effort
to avoid being affected by its cry. Those who have survived the creature’s song
report that the experience is uniquely unnerving, and almost all accounts agree
that there is no other sound as terrible.
While one might assume the cauthooj is a dumb animal, these creatures are in fact
quite a bit smarter than they look. Cauthoojs stalk the perimeter of remote settlements
in hopes of ﬁnding a lone traveler they can feast upon. These patient creatures will wait
in ambush as long as they must to sate their hunger. They
can even understand a few rudimentary words in Sylvan,
although they are incapable of clearly speaking themselves.
This doesn’t stop the cauthooj from attempting to mimic
the sounds it hears, but when it does so, its eerie primal
nature enhances the attempt, leading to the bird’s signature ability
to manipulate minds and encourage conﬂict, a trait the cauthooj is just
barely smart enough to understand—and enjoy.

Hop-Dodge Ǻȓ (move) Trigger The cauthooj is the target of a melee
Strike and is adjacent to another enemy that is also within the
reach of the melee Strike. Eﬀect The cauthooj nimbly hops aside,
redirecting the triggering Strike against the adjacent enemy. The
cauthooj Strides up to half its Speed, and this movement does not trigger reactions.
Speed 35 feet
Melee Ȱɵ beak +26 (agile, deadly 1d12, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d12+12 piercing
Staccato Strike Ȱɵ (mental, primal, sonic) With subtle alterations in the pitch and tone
of its song, the cauthooj directs one creature confused by its Warbling Song to make
a Strike. This works like other Strikes made by confused creatures, except that the
cauthooj chooses the target. If no target is in reach or range, or the creature is
unable to Strike for any other reason, this ability has no eﬀect.
Warbling Song ʚʖ (auditory, incapacitation, mental, primal) The cauthooj gives a
strange, ululating cry that causes nearby creatures to lash out violently and without
control. Each creature within a 120-foot emanation that can hear the cauthooj must
attempt a DC 32 Will save to resist the eﬀect.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Success The target is unaﬀected.
Failure The target is confused for 1 round.
Critical Failure The target is confused for 1 round and immediately attacks itself (in
the normal fashion for attacking oneself while confused). This Strike doesn’t give
the creature a ﬂat check to recover from the confusion.
CAUTHOOJ TREASURE
Like magpies, cauthoojs are
attracted to shiny baubles, and
they often pick up choice treasures
from their victims, depositing
these trinkets in large piles in their
lairs. Not all that glitters is gold,
however, and adventurers will ﬁnd
as many colorful bits of string,
broken mirror shards, and pieces
of costume jewelry as they ﬁnd
coins, magic weapons, and other
valuable treasures.
CAUTHOOJ LOCATIONS
Cauthoojs make their lairs in
small caverns, alcoves, and similar
out-of-the-way places, but claim
large stretches of territory and
wander many miles from their lairs
in search of food. They often hunt
in plains, prairies, and other large,
open expanses.

Cave Worm
Cave worms are gigantic scavengers that bore through the depths of the world,
eating whatever material they ﬁnd. Named for their distinctive colorations, these
worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms
of different colors and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales
speak of white worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and gray
worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.
Purple Worm
The purple worm is the most common and infamous of the cave worms, a
much‑feared monster wandering the twisting tunnels of the Darklands that is capable
of carving out entire cave systems. Tunnels bored by a purple worm don’t always last
long after these creature’s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening mazes
of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to ﬁnd the worm’s
central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm’s prior victims.

BELLY OF THE BEAST
The adventure need not end simply
because the party was ingloriously
swallowed whole by a giant cave
worm. Perhaps the PCs ﬁnd an
undigested item that helps them
survive the inhospitable environ,
or maybe the worm regurgitates
them in a cavern far oﬀ from
where they started. Whatever
the speciﬁcs, you can easily draw
from folklore and popular ﬁction
to create your own "belly of the
worm" adventure for heroes who
wind up on the wrong side of the
monster’s scales.

CENTAUR TREASURE
Centaurs appreciate ﬁne weapons
and armor. Some craft their own
while others use quality armaments
they take from their enemies;
however, due to their forms, they
are unlikely to use armor heavier
than breastplates.
Centaur
Centaurs are legendary hunters and trackers who resemble heavily muscled
humans with the bodies of powerful horses from the waist down. They are
typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques
and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged
folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and
humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty
nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take
kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which
have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature
who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their ﬁnely
honed hunting skills to inﬂict deadly wounds.
Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of
centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an
earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances
with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such
allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs’ honor,
pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe
to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily
integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are
quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and
thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.
Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual
size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly
similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower
bodies—like those of horses—can vary widely from
parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall
and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.
Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members,
usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-
hardened warrior who has carried out many noble
deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their
comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of
their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the
tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the
ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior
might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid
settlements and even rival centaur groups.

CENTIPEDE SPECIES
Centipedes take nearly countless
forms amid nearly every climate,
with speciﬁc traits and abilities
varying wildly between species.
Tangled forests, arid deserts,
foul sewers, deep caverns, and
abandoned buildings are all
common haunts for centipedes,
from oversized specimens capable
of taking down signiﬁcant prey
alone to carpets of frenzied vermin
gathered into a dangerous swarm.
Larger and more specialized
centipedes than the two presented
here exist, such as the sleek giant
whiptail centipede or the immense
titan centipede.
Centipede
Hunters and scavengers that live amid dung and detritus, centipedes are a
relatively common and often reviled threat faced by adventurers. Scurrying about
with surprising speed on the scores of legs attached to their long, segmented
bodies, centipedes strike with poisoned mandibles to slow and torment their prey
with a vicious toxin before they settle down to feed in slow and disgusting leisure.
Giant Centipede
Most giant centipedes (known as sewer centipedes when found in cities) nest in
small groups but hunt alone when they seek out food. Attempts to domesticate
giant centipedes for use as guardians or pets generally end poorly, but some
tribes of goblins, kobolds, and mitﬂits have developed effective methods of
utilizing these vermin as guardians. Other tribes and some humanoid societies
roast and eat centipedes, often with pungent peppers as a savory delicacy,
although care must be taken in preparing the meal to avoid tainting the ﬂesh
with the creature’s venom.

Centipede Swarm
Swarms of centipedes are dangerous indeed, ravenous carpets of skittering
hunger capable of devouring a traveler whole in a matter of minutes. Some
alchemists submerge whole centipedes taken from swarms in their elixirs and
some mutagens, claiming such infusions increase potency, though other say this
is nothing more than quackish claptrap. Kobolds and mitﬂits are both known
to incorporate swarms of centipedes into cunning traps, from simple pits ﬁlled
with vermin or more complex affairs involving chutes that dump the vermin
onto the heads of unwary intruders.

CHANGELING EXILES
Changelings who resist the Call and
abandon the society that raised
them become exiles like the one
presented on this page—creatures
who live solitary lives in the wild
and are often driven to desperate
measures to survive, taking up the
lifestyles of highway bandits or
risk-taking wilderness guides.

Changeling
Children of hags, destined to become hags themselves, changelings face a life of conﬂict.
Born of supernatural creatures who kill and consume the child’s father, changelings are
deposited into their father’s society to be raised. These offspring appear to be members
of their paternal ancestry, and changelings have been found among dwarves, gnomes,
orcs, goblins, and numerous others, but human-ancestry changelings are by far the
most common. Within the normal range for their ancestry, changelings tend toward
slighter builds, darker hair, and pale complexions, though their
most common feature is a nearly universal heterochromia,
leading to widespread superstition about individuals with
differently colored eyes.
As changelings come of age, they sometimes manifest
abilities granted by their hag heritage. Some gain the
ability to see in the dark, some grow ﬁngernails long and
hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger
abilities speciﬁc to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays,
the children of night hags or their cousins the dreamthief hags,
can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and
sleep. Other types of changelings include slag mays, the children
of annis hags; callow mays, the children of green hags; brine
mays, the children of sea hags; and others for each type of hag.
As beings infused with supernatural power, changelings ﬁnd
themselves able to command various traditions of magic, with
many drawn to either the occult magic common among hags or
primal magic.
At roughly the same time in their lives, many changelings—
women in particular—begin to hear the Call, a psychic urging from
their hag mother luring them away from the communities that raised
them. If followed, the Call eventually leads the changeling to the hag’s
coven, where they are subjected to terrible rituals that twist them
into hags themselves. Some changelings, especially those who have
strong social bonds or embrace druidic traditions, are able to resist
this Call and continue on with their mortal lives. The fact that the Call
disproportionately targets female changelings has led to a widespread
misunderstanding that all changelings are female, while in fact male
changelings are simply assumed to be members of their paternal ancestry.

KOBOLD ADORATION
Some kobold groups are fond of
chimera guardians or pets, but
few kobolds have the bravery or
resources to keep a chimera happy
for long. While chimeras are often
pressed into service by more
intelligent creatures, it’s also not
unheard of for a chimera to keep
a herd of unintelligent animals—
lions, goats, or even serpents—as
both companions and food supply.
Chimera
The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up of a
monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion, a
dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it sees,
but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve as a
guardian or even a mount.

head or using the head’s Breath Weapon.
Triple Opportunity A chimera gains 2 extra reactions each round
that it can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity. It
must use a diﬀerent head for each reaction, and it
can’t use more than one on the same triggering
action. If it loses one of its heads, it also loses
one of these extra reactions.

The color of the chimera’s dragon head
determines the area of the Breath
Weapon, the type of damage it deals,
and the type of save to avoid it. The
chimera can’t use Breath Weapon again
for 1d4 rounds.

•	 Blue 60-foot line of electricity (Reﬂex)
•	 Green 30-foot cone of poison (Fortitude)

Draconic Bite A chimera’s dragon head deals an extra 2d6 damage of a
type matching the dragon’s color (see Breath Weapon).
Three-Headed Strike ʚʖ The chimera makes a Strike with its
dragon jaws, lion jaws, and goat horns, each at a –2 penalty
and targeting a diﬀerent creature. These Strikes count as
only one attack for the chimera’s multiple attack penalty,
and the penalty doesn’t increase until after it has made all
three attacks.

CHUUL TREASURE
While chuuls are uninterested
in money, gems, tools, or magic
of any kind, they have a nearly
compulsive need to collect trophies
of their victories, perchance to
savor the memories of the kill and
the meat. What treasure they have
are typically such mementos.
Chuul
Also known as chu’ulothis, these large, armor-plated, crustacean predators lurk
beneath the surface of pools, mires, and ponds, waiting to snatch up prey with
their massive claws before paralyzing them with their tentacles. At that point,
they begin to feed, eating their quarry alive.
Chuuls can live in fresh or saltwater, and indeed are found in aquatic environs
the world over—even in the subterranean oceans and lakes of the Darklands.
While chuuls are good swimmers, they prefer terrestrial prey. Their preferred
method of hunting is by lunging out of the water, paralyzing their victims with
their poison-coated tentacles, then gleefully dragging their twitching food into the
water to drown if they cannot simply eat such morsels alive. Chuuls that dwell
aboveground prefer to dine on lizardfolk, while those swimming the subterranean
lakes of the Darklands readily eat anything but xulgaths, whose ﬂavor and stink
they ﬁnd off-putting.
Chuuls are capable of speech and reason, but these creatures rarely speak with
those outside their species except to taunt their food. Before it begins consuming
its prey, a chuul often speaks in a gurgling, nearly incomprehensible dialect about
how it will enjoy feasting on the creature’s ﬂesh. Perhaps chuuls believe that
insults and degradation lead to more tender and tastier food, but the truth will
likely never be known; almost all chuuls stubbornly refuse any
meaningful conversation, even when imprisoned and compelled
by treats or pain.
It is unknown if a chuul society exists beyond their frenzied
mating season. Chuuls’ intellects seem devoted only toward eating,
causing psychological pain to sentient creatures, decorating their
lairs with mementos of their favorite meals and
victories, and breeding.

CLOAKER ALLIES
On the rare occasions that cloakers
associate with other creatures, they
tend to ally with those ulat‑kinis
(page 12) who are no longer the
thralls of the alghollthus and,
rarely, with deros (pages 84–85),
though they consider the latter
irrational and untrustworthy.
Cloakers never willingly associate
with alghollthus.
CLOAKER LOCATIONS
Cloakers isolate themselves within
the deeper parts of the Darklands
and are concentrated in Sekamina
and Orv. They tend to avoid Nar‑Voth
due to its proximity to the surface.
Cloaker
Weird and paranoid creatures that dwell in the Darklands, cloakers resemble
hideous, ﬂying manta rays. Crafty and careful hunters, their motivations, their
patterns of attack, and even their societies and history are often an inscrutable
jumble of contradicting reports, confused rumors, and terrifying accounts.
Like many of the stranger creatures of Golarion, cloakers were originally created
by the alghollthus, who bred them to spy on their Azlanti thralls. Upon the fall of
the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn,
ﬂed to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of
their new home, their attitudes—particularly regarding their apprehension toward
their former masters—changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism,
sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the
Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia
is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering
another cloaker only brieﬂy to mate before ﬂitting back to isolation.
But there are exceptions. Every so often, a charismatic cloaker priest can call
together a dark cabal of these creatures and other Darklands denizens to worship
unspeakable ancient gods. These rare cloakers whip their acolytes and followers
into a frenzy of dark rituals and heinous acts. While these cults are depraved and
destructive, they rarely survive longer than their founder.

a +14 bonus against an adjacent creature’s Reﬂex DC. If it succeeds, it
envelops the target, who is restrained. Attacks that hit an enveloping
cloaker deal half their damage to the cloaker and half to the trapped
victim. The cloaker can’t Fly, and when it moves using its land
Speed it moves the enveloped creature with it. The cloaker can
make only jaws Strikes against the restrained creature but can
make tail Strikes against other creatures.
A creature that voluntarily puts on the cloaker becomes
engulfed automatically. A cloaker can engulf only Large or
smaller creatures, and no more than one creature at a time.
Infrasonic Moan ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, mental) The cloaker
lets out an infrasonic moan that has one of the eﬀects below.
A creature that succeeds at a DC 22 Will save is unaﬀected. Any
creature that attempts this save becomes temporarily immune for 1
hour. Because the moan is infrasonic, most humanoids don’t detect the source of
their plight if they aren’t already aware of the cloaker.

COCKATRICE TREASURE
Cockatrice lairs sometimes include
discarded gear from past victims
or smooth, pretty stones disgorged
from the creature’s craw. Gem
workers especially prize precious
stones that have been polished to
perfection in a cockatrice’s crop,
and may pay a high price for these
so-called "cockatrice rocks." Soft
materials suitable for nesting, such
as cloth and leather, rarely survive
a cockatrice’s attentions, but metal
goods are often left in ﬁne working
order, since cockatrices seem to
have little interest in anything
shiny they can’t ﬁt in their gullet.
Cockatrice
Ugly and aggressive, the dread cockatrice stalks garbage pits and hillside dumps in
search of prey that it can turn to stone with its petrifying beak and subsequently
consume piece by broken piece. Cockatrices resemble gaunt and sickly roosters
with bat wings and serpentine tails, and they rarely grow more than 2 feet tall
and twice as long. Their absentminded clucking gives smart prey ample warning
of their presence, and when angered cockatrices let out a shrill crow like that
of a rooster. Their peck releases a magical toxin that causes ﬂesh to quickly
calcify, and any creature pecked repeatedly by an irritable cockatrice eventually
transforms into a stone statue of itself.
The ﬁrst cockatrice is rumored to have hatched from a rooster’s egg incubated
on a dung hill by a toad. Whether or not the rumor is true, the cockatrice’s
monstrous appearance certainly doesn’t contradict its strange and ﬁlthy origin
story, and these creatures are more than capable of propagating on their own.
Cockatrices are remarkably fecund and gather in ﬂocks of up to a dozen
members. Each ﬂock contains only a few females. The males—which differ in
appearance from the females by having warty wattles and gnarled combs—
often ﬁght with each other, with lower-ranking males eventually driven away
to ﬁnd their own lairs or compete among other ﬂocks. Most creatures who run
afoul of a solitary cockatrice do so with one of these surly outcasts.
Cockatrice lairs are often littered with fragments of statuary from past
victims—although these are as likely to be remnants of frogs, lizards, and insects
as people. Curiously, weasels and ferrets, who inﬁltrate cockatrice lairs to steal
their eggs, are immune to the creatures’ petrifying bites. For unknown reasons,
cockatrices are both terriﬁed of and enraged by conventional roosters, and they
are equally likely to ﬂee or attack when confronted by one.
Particularly brave (or foolhardy) individuals sometimes keep cockatrices as pets
or guard animals. In their natural habitat among plains, forests, and sewers near
humanoid settlements, cockatrices are content to live off vermin or scraps of waste,
but their greatest pleasure is consuming warm meals of freshly petriﬁed ﬂesh.

Calciﬁcation (incapacitation, primal, transmutation)
A peck from a cockatrice hardens the ﬂesh
of the creature struck. The target must
succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or
become slowed 1 (or slowed 2 on a
critical failure). Further failed saves
against calciﬁcation increase the slowed
condition. Once a creature’s actions
are reduced to 0 by calciﬁcation, that
creature becomes petriﬁed.
Every 24 hours after it was petriﬁed,
the victim can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude
save to recover. On a success, it becomes ﬂesh again, but is slowed 1 for the next
24 hours. On a critical success, the creature recovers and isn’t slowed. On a failure,
the creature remains petriﬁed, but can try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure,
the petriﬁcation is permanent, and the creature can’t attempt any more saves.

tropical areas, either in fresh or salt
water. Alligators are found in more
varied climates, but only in fresh
water. Deinosuchuses, particularly
the largest and most dangerous of
their kind, prefer estuaries, bays,
or other brackish bodies of water
connected to both river and sea.
Crocodile
Powerful and primeval in appearance, crocodiles are dangerous natural predators
that dwell in marshes, riverbeds, swamps, and other wetlands.
Crocodile
Crocodiles can be found basking on riverbanks, lurking in swamps, or ﬂoating
in lakes. They are usually are indistinguishable from logs when viewed from
afar—at least until they attack. Alligators have similar statistics, but because
they often live in more temperate climates, they endure cold temperatures
better. Unlike alligators, crocodiles can tolerate salt water. Both are formidable
predators that are likely to devour careless adventurers who fail to watch where
they step.

CYCLOPS SEERS
Great cyclopes are traditionally
violent creatures, but some retain
fragments of the old ways that lull
them into periods of calm. During
such times, they can be incredible
sources of information, but one
must take care to be well away
from the great cyclops’s lair before
its bestial rage wakens once more.
Ranged Ȱɵ heavy crossbow +8 (range increment 120 feet, reload 2), Damage 1d10+4 piercing
Swipe ʚʖ (ﬂourish) The cyclops makes a melee Strike and compares the attack roll
result to the AC of up to two foes, each of whom must be within its melee reach and
adjacent to each other. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature hit. A
Swipe counts as two attacks for the cyclops’s multiple attack penalty.
Great Cyclops
Gigantic, dim-witted loners, the great cyclopes embody their lesser kin writ
large. They are both stronger and more violent, but their uncontrolled vision
into possible futures has driven them beyond reason. They see every moment
as a potential storm of uncontrollable fury, and out of a desperate desire for
peace, quiet, and an end to their hunger, they lash out at all who come near. Wise
creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost.
Debate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They
are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by
their lesser kin, but they are now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other
scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species.
Whatever foolish decision or wayward curse caused the end of their civilization
is still playing out, occasionally causing a cyclops to withdraw from its own kind,
lose all semblance of intellect, and mutate into a lumbering, feral colossus. It
is fortunate indeed that the great cyclops prefers to dwell far from humanoid
settlements, because its immeasurable bloodlust inspires it to destroy virtually
anything that moves, from dinosaurs and other monsters to the occasional
explorer or soon-to-be-lost caravan.

cacodaemon grows a ﬁst-sized soul gem (Hardness 2, HP 8) in its gut and can regurgitate
it at any time as an Interact action. Destroying the gem frees the soul within but does
not return the deceased creature to life. The caster of a spell to return a creature to life
whose soul is trapped within a soul gem must succeed at a DC 30 Religion check. On a
success, the soul gem shatters and the creature is returned to life as normal for the spell.
By using an Interact action, a ﬁend can ingest a soul gem it is holding, condemning
the soul to the ﬁend’s home plane. The ﬁend gains fast healing 5 for 1 minute.
Ceustodaemon (Guardian Daemon)
Ceustodaemons are formed from the souls of vile mortals, particularly those who
took efforts to hasten their own death, their willingness shaping them into daemonic
servants. Their otherworldly senses make them useful for protecting vaults and similar
locations on the Material Plane. Ceustodaemons are created to serve, but always
seek ways to subvert their bindings, so they can rend their mortal summoners’
ﬂesh. The worst type of conjurer calls upon ceustodaemons merely to set them
free into the world in hopes of currying favor with the powers of Abaddon.

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (divine, evocation, ﬁre) The ceustodaemon
breathes ﬂames in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take
7d6 ﬁre damage (DC 24 basic Reﬂex save). The ceustodaemon
and each creature that fails the save catch ﬁre, taking 2d6
persistent ﬁre damage. The breath weapon can’t be used
again for 1d4 rounds.
Drawn to Service When bringing a ceustodaemon to another
plane with eﬀects like a planar binding or planar ally ritual,
the primary and secondary skill DCs are reduced by 5, and the
ceustodaemon demands only half the normal cost for its service.
Vicious Wounds On a successful jaws or claw Strike, the ceustodaemon
viciously tears into its victim as similar wounds appear on its
own body. The target takes an extra 1d6 amount of damage,
and the ceustodaemon takes the same extra damage. If this
extra damage to the target is doubled, due to a critical
hit, the ceustodaemon takes double damage as well.
Leukodaemon (Pestilence Daemon)
These skull-headed, vulture-winged daemons are harbingers of
pestilence and servants of their patron Horseman, Apollyon. Manifestations of evil
souls who perished from disease in life, leukodaemons work tirelessly to spread
disease across all the worlds of the multiverse. More than any other daemon,
SOUL GEMS AS TREASURE
Soul gems are traded in illicit
markets, a tradition celestials and

gems’ value varies, but is generally
worth an amount relative to the

a disease into full bloom. It chooses a target in its aura of pestilence that’s
currently aﬀected by a disease. That creature must attempt a Fortitude
save against the disease as if the interval for the disease’s current stage
had passed.
Astradaemon (Void Daemon)
These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct assault
against a soul or life-force—the same numbing death they bring with their fell
touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their
time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There,
they capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or
punishments and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters.
These horrifying predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of
the River of Souls in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims.
Psychopomps have a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes
between them and these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff
of legend.
THE DAEMONIC PARADOX
Daemons embody a fundamental
paradox—while they are
incarnations of death and seek
to devour all that lives, they are
themselves living creatures. Some
speak of a glorious end time after
which reality will ﬁnally be free
of the contagion that is life itself.
Most daemons give no thought to
this paradox.

and mindful of their mood, as the giants can be quick to anger or aggressive

Most storm giants have complexions akin to the crystal blue of the ocean or the
warm violet of a sky touched by the setting sun. Their hair tends to be dark purple,
blue, or black, and their eyes often have a silvery sheen. A typical storm giant stands

Rune Giant
Magically crafted and bred by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema to
and tyrants among their own kind, who were given power to command and
magically control other giants. The rune giants themselves served even more
powerful masters—potent wizards known as runelords—and in so doing
commanded entire armies of giants on behalf of the runelords’ empires.
In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted as a
people of their own, though to the outside world they’re little more than
fabled horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants. Rune giants
usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges,
but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys,
or even more remote or magical regions.
Rune giants’ striking charcoal ﬂesh is decorated by dozens of runes, which
are potent manifestations of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are towering
creatures, averaging at 40 feet in height and weighing 25,000 pounds.

STONE GOLEMS
Depending on the material from
which it is made and the care that
went into crafting it, a destroyed
stone golem may be worth as much
as an immaculately sculpted marble
pillar or as little as a pile of rubble.
Vulnerable to Disintegrate A disintegrate spell aﬀects the golem but deals half the

Quicken Ȳ˓ (divine, transmutation) Frequency Once per day. Trigger The clay golem’s

golem becomes quickened for 1 minute.
Speed 20 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +24 (magical, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d10+12 bludgeoning plus cursed wound
Berserk Slam Ȱɵ Requirement The golem is berserk. Eﬀect The clay golem Strikes
with its ﬁst at a –1 circumstance penalty. If its Strike hits, the clay golem deals an
additional 1d8 damage and knocks the target prone.
Cursed Wound (divine, curse, necromancy) A creature hit by the clay golem’s ﬁst must
succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be cursed until healed to its maximum HP. The
cursed creature can’t regain HP except via magic, and anyone casting a spell to heal
the creature must succeed at a DC 29 counteract check or the healing has no eﬀect.
The golem’s counteract level is equal to its creature level.
Stone Golem
Stone golems are slow and steady constructs typically carved from marble or
granite. They’re often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem
crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues.
Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or
missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn’t
adversely impact the golems’ functionality.
Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain
ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out
orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much
more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or
higher and never smaller than Huge in size—most are Gargantuan.
Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so
dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause
surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to
buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In
addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems
attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking
down multiple targets at once.

DEATH CURSES
The death curses of the linnorms
are often the subjects of tragic

themselves vanquishing heroes
for slaying a linnorm often meet
their dooms soon thereafter,
succumbing to these curses well
after the death of the linnorm
