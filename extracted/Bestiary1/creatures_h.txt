Hive Mother
Ankhrav hive mothers are fearsome predators that one can easily distinguish
from the typical ankhrav not only by their greater size, but the presence of a
large pair of razor-sharp, mantis-like arms.

for Burrow, Stride, or Strike actions. The hive mother

ANKHRAV BURROWS
As if the appearance of a hungry
ankhrav in a stretch of farmland
isn’t bad enough, it almost always
indicates the proximity of an
ankhrav hive nearby. A disturbing
number of ankhravs can infest
a lair. However, adventurers
brave enough to crawl through
the tangled burrows are often
rewarded with large amounts of
treasure as ankhravs have a habit
of dragging their victims back
to the deepest corners of their
den to feast, usually discarding
the remains with most of the
gear intact.

Legion Archon
Despite their ﬂaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of
peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual beneﬁt
rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to ﬁght against ﬁendish

HELL HOUND MINIONS
On the Material Plane, these ﬁends
are sometimes found in the service
of ﬁre-loving monsters such as
ﬁre giants or efreet, as well as
mortals who seek to tame some of
the raw power of Hell. In Cheliax,
Hellknights occasionally call
upon hell hounds to track down
fugitives and traitors.
Hell Hound
Hell hounds are ﬁendish, extraplanar canines hailing from the pit that can hunt
down quarry and breathe supernatural gouts of ﬂame. They are temperamental
and quick to aggressive behavior.
Hell Hound
A hell hound’s appearance dismisses any doubts as to its infernal origins—ﬂesh
the color of burning pitch, teeth as sharp as any ﬁend’s pitchfork, and a shroud of
ever-burning hellﬁre are all trademark features.

LIVING WITH HOBGOBLINS
With few exceptions, the only
non-goblinoids in a hobgoblin
settlement or army are slaves
(or at least regarded as such).
Hobgoblins occasionally make use
of bugbears as assassins or spies,
and most hobgoblin tribes include
a small group of goblins who eke
out a meager existence on the
fringes of hobgoblin society.
Hobgoblin Archer
Bands of hobgoblin soldiers typically have at least one archer among their ranks.
In smaller groups, the hobgoblin archer also serves as that band’s captain.

Hobgoblin General
Hobgoblin generals serve as leaders of entire armies and rulers of hobgoblin
settlements. A general does not permit the luxuries of rule to soften them. They
lead their forces on the ﬁeld of battle and view this opportunity to excel in a
ﬁght at the head of an army as the true reward for a life spent honing one’s skills

SOULBOUND HOMUNCULI
Most homunculi use a dose of
their creator’s blood as their spark
of life, but it’s possible to use a
technique similar to that used in
the crafting of a soulbound doll
(page 306) to give a homunculus
a personality and the semblance
of life. These homunculi gain the
soulbound trait, can speak, and do
not have a special link to a creator,
yet the process tends to warp
the soul used so that, more often
than not, what rises in the new
homunculus body is a parody of
its prior life. As such, soulbound
homunculi are generally created by
cruel spellcasters as a method
of humiliating and tormenting
vanquished enemies.
Homunculus
A homunculus is a tiny servitor construct created by a crafter to serve as a spy,
scout, messenger, or assistant. When a crafter ﬁrst begins to study the art of
creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus ﬁrst, since the creation process
is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator’s own
blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the
homunculus to gain a spark of the creator’s intellect, as well as the same moral
values and some of the creator’s basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their
own devices never stray far from their masters.
In most cases, a homunculus doesn’t survive the death of its master for long.
Deprived of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly
self-destructive, and some even end up battering themselves to destruction. Rarely,
a homunculus with a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often
seeing itself as its deceased creator’s child or successor and attempting to further
its creator’s legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the
homunculus was in close proximity to its master upon that
creature’s death, a portion of the dead master’s soul “infects” the
surviving homunculus as it passes on to the afterlife. This doesn’t result
in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of
the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a
greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the
ability to speak. Over time, a few of these “awakened” homunculi even go
so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior
masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and
complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master,
and at worst they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a
free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator’s class, becoming
a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit.
Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root,
spring water, and a pint of the creator’s own blood. It is possible
for a separate donor to provide the blood, but the process is
more difﬁcult.

same alignment as its creator and is utterly faithful. If the homunculus
is destroyed, the master takes 2d10 mental damage. If the master is slain,
the homunculus becomes mindless, claims its current location as its lair, and
instinctively attacks anyone who comes near.

GOBLINS AND HORSES
Goblins have many superstitions
and quirks, but few of them are
stronger than their fear and
hatred of horses. This isn’t a
one-sided aﬀair. Horses also fear
and hate goblins, and some have
been known to go out of their
way to harm a goblin. A goblin
trying to mount a horse is nearly
always subject to a torrent of
violent bucking, as the horse
does everything in its power to
ﬂing the goblin to the ground and
within reach of its hooves.
Horse
Horses serve as mounts and beasts of burden in many societies. They are
loyal and typically gentle creatures, and they are invaluable to those looking
to travel long distances. Smaller folk, like gnomes and halﬂings, often utilize
ponies as mounts, while horses are the favored steeds for humans and other
Medium humanoids. Most horses that the average humanoid encounters are
domesticated, though large herds of these powerful animals can be found in
the wild.

HYENA LEGENDS
The hyena’s intense cunning,
combined with its unnerving
laughter, has caused hyenas to
become associated with all manner
of evil—hyenas are claimed to rob
graves, steal children, and wield
sinister supernatural powers.
Though normal hyenas are no
more malicious than any other
natural predator, their unearned
reputation often causes witches,
warlords, and ill-natured creatures
to seek out hyenas as pets or
guard animals. The fact that
gnolls in particular have a special
preference for hyenas, considering
the animals to be close relatives,
does little to improve the animal’s
already-poor reputation.
Hyena
Hyenas are pack-hunting scavengers known for their unnerving, laughter-like
cries, and they aren’t above supplementing their carrion diets with fresh prey.
Hyena
Hyenas are cunning, powerfully built carnivores that bear a heavy resemblance
to dogs and other canines, though they are not themselves canines. Though all
hyenas are often maligned as cowardly carrion eaters, their tactics depend on
their speciﬁc breed: spotted hyenas are active pack hunters that kill most of
their prey themselves, while striped and brown hyenas are more likely to be
scavengers. Their jaws are exceptionally powerful, allowing hyenas to seize a
victim and pull it to the rest of the pack.

“WE ARE DRAGONS!”
Kobolds consider themselves
scions of dragonkind, and they
are extremely proud of this
purported heritage, no matter
how laughable other creatures
might consider these claims.
Despite such skepticism, kobolds
share more than a superﬁcial
resemblance to true dragons, with
scale colorations closely matching
the colors seen among chromatic
dragonkind. Some kobolds
develop a strong propensity
toward powerful draconic magic
and manifest these chromatic
traits with more intensity. These
so-called dragon mages are highly
respected by other kobolds, and
often rise to leadership positions
within the tribe.
Kobold
Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids who carry physical similarities to true
dragons. They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in
either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after
the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic
than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing
ﬁeld between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the
darkness and at range, and kobold artiﬁcers and engineers master the art of
simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled
at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run
assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed
in return.
Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these
virtues toward selﬁsh ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that
maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily
swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part
due to kobolds’ innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude
than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that
kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe,
and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures
when they can. While kobolds may scheme against other leaders, especially those
that control them via subjugation, dragons are usually viewed with adoration, no
matter how brutal they might be to their kobold minions.
Kobold Warrior
The typical kobold trains with agile weaponry, favoring the light pick for
its use in crafting new tunnels to expand their domains through
underground reaches. Kobolds are capable of landing
sneaky strikes against unsuspecting foes but are just as
quick to scamper off to safety when they don’t, as a
group, outnumber their enemies at least two to one.

DIABOLIC KOBOLDS
Certain kobold tribes eschew any
concept of draconic lineage entirely
and instead place their faith in the
archdevils of Hell. These diabolist
kobolds view those of their kind
who simper at the feet of dragons
as pathetic wretches. That they
perform the same fearful worship
to their chosen devil does not strike
these infernally minded kobolds as
an irony at all.
Kobold Scout
Most kobolds encountered outside of a well-defended warren or lair are kobold
scouts, creatures trained for stalking and the hunt.
