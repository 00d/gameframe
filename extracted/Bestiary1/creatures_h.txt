Armor-Rending Bite ʚʖ The ankhrav makes a mandibles Strike; if the Strike hits, the
target’s armor takes the damage and the acid damage bypasses the armor’s Hardness.
Spray Acid ʚʖ (acid) Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect The ankhrav spews acid in a

Hive Mother
Ankhrav hive mothers are fearsome predators that one can easily distinguish
from the typical ankhrav not only by their greater size, but the presence of a
large pair of razor-sharp, mantis-like arms.

Armor-Rending Bite ʚʖ The hive mother makes a
mandibles Strike; if the Strike hits, the target’s armor

Frenzy Pheromone ʚʖ The hive mother unleashes a
pheromone that causes all other ankhravs within a 100-foot
emanation to become quickened 1 until the start of the hive
mother’s next turn, and they can use the extra action only
for Burrow, Stride, or Strike actions. The hive mother
can’t unleash the pheromone again for 1d4 rounds.

in a 60-foot cone, dealing 8d6 acid damage and 1d6
persistent acid damage (DC 26 basic Reﬂex save). It
can’t spew acid again for 1d4 rounds.
ANKHRAV BURROWS
As if the appearance of a hungry
ankhrav in a stretch of farmland
isn’t bad enough, it almost always
indicates the proximity of an
ankhrav hive nearby. A disturbing
number of ankhravs can infest
a lair. However, adventurers
brave enough to crawl through
the tangled burrows are often
rewarded with large amounts of
treasure as ankhravs have a habit
of dragging their victims back
to the deepest corners of their
den to feast, usually discarding
the remains with most of the
gear intact.

Ape
While many apes exhibit peaceful or reclusive behavior, gorillas can be territorial,
and the megaprimatus is especially aggressive and dangerous.
Gorilla
Gorillas can be territorial creatures, particularly if provoked by hunters or the
presence of more dangerous monsters. A gorilla uses its fangs and powerful arms
to bite and pummel trespassers with wild abandon.

# HORNED ARCHON

ARCHON LOCATIONS
While commonly found in Heaven,
archons can also be encountered
on the ﬁendish planes in their
endless crusade against evil. On
the Material Plane they are usually
encountered as advisors or saviors
to those in need.
Horned Archon
Horned archons are secretive and tireless sentinels and scouts, patrolling the Outer
Sphere’s untamed wilds for evil to eliminate and keeping small communities safe from
demons, devils, and worse. They resemble muscular humans with the head, horns,
and legs of a stag. When requested to do so by their patrons, especially Erastil, they
journey to the Material Plane and patrol dangerous frontier areas, secretly performing
acts of kindness such as leading hunters to food, helping lost children, and driving off
evil creatures. Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana and Elysium, horned archons
are among the best at understanding the perspectives of other celestials.

Archon’s Door Once per day, if an archon sees another
creature cast dimension door, it can cast an innate
dimension door (heightened to 5th level) within 1 round
to attempt to follow that creature to the maximum distance
of the archon’s dimension door. If the archon’s dimension
door has enough distance, the archon appears the same
distance and direction from the creature as before
either used dimension door.
Touch of Charity Ȱɵ (healing, manipulate,

another creature to take on that creature’s
wounds, transferring up to 30 of the
horned archon’s HP to the touched
creature.

Legion Archon
Despite their ﬂaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of
peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual beneﬁt
rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to ﬁght against ﬁendish
powers—especially ﬁends that embody the sin of wrath—legion archons don’t
hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.

# HILL GIANT
================================================================================


Bestiary
OVERSIZED THEMES
Giants are larger-than-life foes.
While many giants have themes
that tie them to elemental or
magical forces, the primary theme
giants share is that they embody a
classic cultural trope as their basis.
Fire giants, for example, can be
seen as oversized smiths, while
hill giants should evoke the
ﬂavor of an oversized bully.
Giant
Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout
the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.
Hill Giant
Selﬁsh and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately cowards.
Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages the
defenseless but is quick to ﬂee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better
organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of their
own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.

Throw Rock Ȱɵ
Wide Swing Ȱɵ The hill giant makes a single greatclub Strike and compares the attack
roll result to the ACs of up to two foes within its reach. This counts as two attacks
for the hill giant’s multiple attack penalty.
Stone Giant
Stone giants are stoic, reclusive herders and artists who have a rich
history and collection of traditions. They dwell in caves in tall
mountains and craggy ranges, where their grayish skin allows
them to blend in with their surroundings and go unnoticed by
imperceptive adventurers. Those benign travelers who come
across a tribe of stone giants need not worry much, however,
for stone giants do not actively invite confrontation or strife.
They are, by and large, a peaceful people who seek wisdom
through exploration of nature and long meditations on
the elements of the natural world. Their elders are the wisest of stone
giants, and use their charisma and druidic magic to lead their tribes to
prosperity and harmony with nature.
A typical stone giant stands 12 feet in height and weighs about
1,500 pounds.

================================================================================
# HARPY
================================================================================


Bestiary
HARPY EXILES
Most harpies are cruel and
sadistic, but now and then a harpy
manages to escape from its family
and becomes exposed to the
wider world. Eyes opened, these
harpy exiles are almost always
more mild-mannered,
cleanly, and open
to non-combat
interactions.
Harpy
Harpies are ﬁlthy amalgamations of human and bird, resembling feral humans
with wings, talons, and mouths full of sharp teeth. They use captivating songs
to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transﬁxed. They enjoy
causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it creates a
savory ﬂavor in the ﬂesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient
prey—humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if
sufﬁciently hungry, they dislike their ﬂavor and avoid eating them if possible. This
doesn’t comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.
Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters
of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with
danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization make better efforts to keep
clean, though these efforts have mixed results.
Harpies live in family groups or larger clans. They
are lightweight despite their size, standing 5 feet tall
and weighing only around 90 pounds. While most use
relatively simple weapons, some harpies take pride in
learning and mastering the use of more complex tools of
war such as swords and slings. Those who master the use of
the bow, in particular, are often regarded as heroes among
their kind and terrors among their victims.

Captivating
Song
Ȱɵ
(auditory,
concentrate,
enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal) The
harpy cries out an eerie, compelling melody. Each
non-harpy creature within a 300-foot aura must attempt
a DC 21 Will save to avoid becoming captivated by the
harpy’s song. The eﬀect lasts for 1 round, but if
the harpy uses this ability again on subsequent
rounds, it extends the duration by 1 round
for all aﬀected creatures. Once a creature
succeeds at any save against Captivating
Song, that creature is temporarily immune
to Captivating Songs for 24 hours.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend each of its actions to move closer to
the harpy as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated
creature is adjacent to the harpy, it stays still and doesn’t act. If attacked by the harpy,
the creature is freed from captivation at the end of the harpy’s turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but if attacked by the harpy, the creature can attempt a new
save at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end of the harpy’s turn.

SOULBOUND HOMUNCULI
Most homunculi use a dose of
their creator’s blood as their spark
of life, but it’s possible to use a
technique similar to that used in
the crafting of a soulbound doll
(page 306) to give a homunculus
a personality and the semblance
of life. These homunculi gain the
soulbound trait, can speak, and do
not have a special link to a creator,
yet the process tends to warp
the soul used so that, more often
than not, what rises in the new
homunculus body is a parody of
its prior life. As such, soulbound
homunculi are generally created by
cruel spellcasters as a method
of humiliating and tormenting
vanquished enemies.
Homunculus
A homunculus is a tiny servitor construct created by a crafter to serve as a spy,
scout, messenger, or assistant. When a crafter ﬁrst begins to study the art of
creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus ﬁrst, since the creation process
is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator’s own
blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the
homunculus to gain a spark of the creator’s intellect, as well as the same moral
values and some of the creator’s basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their
own devices never stray far from their masters.
In most cases, a homunculus doesn’t survive the death of its master for long.
Deprived of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly
self-destructive, and some even end up battering themselves to destruction. Rarely,
a homunculus with a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often
seeing itself as its deceased creator’s child or successor and attempting to further
its creator’s legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the
homunculus was in close proximity to its master upon that
creature’s death, a portion of the dead master’s soul “infects” the
surviving homunculus as it passes on to the afterlife. This doesn’t result
in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of
the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a
greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the
ability to speak. Over time, a few of these “awakened” homunculi even go
so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior
masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and
complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master,
and at worst they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a
free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator’s class, becoming
a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit.
Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root,
spring water, and a pint of the creator’s own blood. It is possible
for a separate donor to provide the blood, but the process is
more difﬁcult.

GOBLINS AND HORSES
Goblins have many superstitions
and quirks, but few of them are
stronger than their fear and
hatred of horses. This isn’t a
one-sided aﬀair. Horses also fear
and hate goblins, and some have
been known to go out of their
way to harm a goblin. A goblin
trying to mount a horse is nearly
always subject to a torrent of
violent bucking, as the horse
does everything in its power to
ﬂing the goblin to the ground and
within reach of its hooves.
Horse
Horses serve as mounts and beasts of burden in many societies. They are
loyal and typically gentle creatures, and they are invaluable to those looking
to travel long distances. Smaller folk, like gnomes and halﬂings, often utilize
ponies as mounts, while horses are the favored steeds for humans and other
Medium humanoids. Most horses that the average humanoid encounters are
domesticated, though large herds of these powerful animals can be found in
the wild.

Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Head Regrowth A hydra ordinarily has ﬁve heads. A creature can attempt to sever one of
the hydra’s heads by speciﬁcally targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head’s
Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end
of any creature’s turn.
A hydra can regrow a severed head using Hydra Regeneration. A creature can prevent
this regrowth by dealing acid or ﬁre damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target
acid or ﬁre eﬀects need to be targeted at a speciﬁc stump, but eﬀects that deal splash
damage or aﬀect areas covering the hydra’s whole space cauterize all stumps if they
deal acid or ﬁre damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any acid or ﬁre damage,
the stump is cauterized instantly. If all ﬁve heads are cauterized, the hydra dies.
Hydra Regeneration The hydra has regeneration equal to 3 × the number of heads it has. If
a hydra’s body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized,
the hydra attempts a DC 25 Fortitude save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration.
On a success, one uncauterized stump regrows two heads; on a critical success, two
uncauterized stumps regrow into two heads each. The hydra can never grow more
than double the number of heads it ordinarily has. The hydra’s regeneration only fully
deactivates if all its heads are severed and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it dies.
Multiple Opportunities A hydra gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads
beyond the ﬁrst, which it can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity. It can’t use
more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several
squares within its reach, and the hydra must use a diﬀerent head for
each Attack of Opportunity it makes. Whenever one of the
hydra’s heads is severed, the hydra loses 1
of its extra reactions per round.

Focused
Assault
ʚʖ
The
hydra
attacks a single target with its heads,
overwhelming its foe with multiple
attacks and leaving almost nowhere to
dodge. The hydra Strikes with its fangs.
On a successful attack, the hydra deals damage from its
fangs Strike to the target, plus an additional 1d6 damage
for every head it has beyond the ﬁrst. Even on a failed
attack, the hydra deals the damage from one fangs Strike
to the target creature, though it still misses completely on
a critical failure. This counts toward the hydra’s multiple
attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of
heads the hydra has.
Storm of Jaws ʚʖ The hydra makes a number of Strikes up to
its number of heads, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks
count toward the hydra’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty
doesn’t increase until after the hydra makes all its attacks.
VARIANT HYDRAS
Scholars of bestial lore can
describe several hydra variations.
Though rare, hydras with more
than ﬁve heads live in very
isolated areas, sometimes guarding
incredibly powerful artifacts.
Explorers who have visited colder
swamps and frozen glaciers tell
tales of hydras with blue-tinged
scales that are immune to the
cold and can exhale clouds of icy
death. Similar stories describe
ﬁery hydras that breathe gouts of
ﬂame and swim in the molten lava
of active volcanoes.

HYENA LEGENDS
The hyena’s intense cunning,
combined with its unnerving
laughter, has caused hyenas to
become associated with all manner
of evil—hyenas are claimed to rob
graves, steal children, and wield
sinister supernatural powers.
Though normal hyenas are no
more malicious than any other
natural predator, their unearned
reputation often causes witches,
warlords, and ill-natured creatures
to seek out hyenas as pets or
guard animals. The fact that
gnolls in particular have a special
preference for hyenas, considering
the animals to be close relatives,
does little to improve the animal’s
already-poor reputation.
Hyena
Hyenas are pack-hunting scavengers known for their unnerving, laughter-like
cries, and they aren’t above supplementing their carrion diets with fresh prey.
Hyena
Hyenas are cunning, powerfully built carnivores that bear a heavy resemblance
to dogs and other canines, though they are not themselves canines. Though all
hyenas are often maligned as cowardly carrion eaters, their tactics depend on
their speciﬁc breed: spotted hyenas are active pack hunters that kill most of
their prey themselves, while striped and brown hyenas are more likely to be
scavengers. Their jaws are exceptionally powerful, allowing hyenas to seize a
victim and pull it to the rest of the pack.

Bestiary
“WE ARE DRAGONS!”
Kobolds consider themselves
scions of dragonkind, and they
are extremely proud of this
purported heritage, no matter
how laughable other creatures
might consider these claims.
Despite such skepticism, kobolds
share more than a superﬁcial
resemblance to true dragons, with
scale colorations closely matching
the colors seen among chromatic
dragonkind. Some kobolds
develop a strong propensity
toward powerful draconic magic
and manifest these chromatic
traits with more intensity. These
so-called dragon mages are highly
respected by other kobolds, and
often rise to leadership positions
within the tribe.
Kobold
Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids who carry physical similarities to true
dragons. They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in
either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after
the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic
than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing
ﬁeld between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the
darkness and at range, and kobold artiﬁcers and engineers master the art of
simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled
at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run
assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed
in return.
Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these
virtues toward selﬁsh ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that
maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily
swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part
due to kobolds’ innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude
than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that
kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe,
and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures
when they can. While kobolds may scheme against other leaders, especially those
that control them via subjugation, dragons are usually viewed with adoration, no
matter how brutal they might be to their kobold minions.
Kobold Warrior
The typical kobold trains with agile weaponry, favoring the light pick for
its use in crafting new tunnels to expand their domains through
underground reaches. Kobolds are capable of landing
sneaky strikes against unsuspecting foes but are just as
quick to scamper off to safety when they don’t, as a
group, outnumber their enemies at least two to one.

DIABOLIC KOBOLDS
Certain kobold tribes eschew any
concept of draconic lineage entirely
and instead place their faith in the
archdevils of Hell. These diabolist
kobolds view those of their kind
who simper at the feet of dragons
as pathetic wretches. That they
perform the same fearful worship
to their chosen devil does not strike
these infernally minded kobolds as
an irony at all.
Kobold Scout
Most kobolds encountered outside of a well-defended warren or lair are kobold
scouts, creatures trained for stalking and the hunt.
