Kolyarut
Kolyarut inevitables are enforcers of bargains and punishers of those who fail
to uphold them. Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among a
humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable
inevitables, and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among
the most talkative of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an
encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts
in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.

Pleroma
Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation
of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is
a constant state of ﬂux between these two poles, their forms a shifting
cloak of black where galaxies and other celestial objects ﬂit in and out of
existence, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature,
self-contained universe.
Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and
malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They
believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this
essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of
the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.

# KOBOLD SCOUT
================================================================================


DIABOLIC KOBOLDS
Certain kobold tribes eschew any
concept of draconic lineage entirely
and instead place their faith in the
archdevils of Hell. These diabolist
kobolds view those of their kind
who simper at the feet of dragons
as pathetic wretches. That they
perform the same fearful worship
to their chosen devil does not strike
these infernally minded kobolds as
an irony at all.
Kobold Scout
Most kobolds encountered outside of a well-defended warren or lair are kobold
scouts, creatures trained for stalking and the hunt.

KRAKEN TREASURE
A kraken’s hoard includes the
plunder of ships lost at sea and
the wealth of sunken cities.
Virtually anything could be
found in a kraken lair, but they
especially covet scrolls, spell
books, and other tomes of ancient
lore, as well as gemstones and
rareﬁed raw materials found only
in the ocean depths.
Kraken
A kraken is an enormous, squid-like leviathan with a cruel intelligence. It hunts
ships, whales, and heroes alike. The hatred and envy krakens hold for their rivals,
the alghollthus, has led many krakens to make their lairs in sunken cities, where
they can sift through ancient lore for long-lost arcane secrets.

Altered Weather (aura, evocation, primal) A kraken reshapes the weather within 2

based on its emotional state, at the GM’s discretion. If the kraken dies, the weather

Constrict Ȱɵ 2d10+17 bludgeoning, DC 40. On a failed save, a creature that is holding
its breath loses 1d4 rounds worth of air.
Double Attack Ȱɵ The kraken makes two Strikes with two diﬀerent arms or tentacles, each
limb targeting a diﬀerent creature. Double Attack counts
as two attacks toward the kraken’s multiple attack
penalty for further actions, but the penalty doesn’t
increase until after both attacks are made. If the
kraken subsequently uses the Grab action, it Grabs
any number of creatures it hit with Double Attack.
Ink Cloud Ȱɵ The kraken emits a cloud of black,
venomous ink in an 80-foot emanation.
This cloud has no eﬀect outside
water. Creatures inside the ink
cloud are exposed to kraken
ink poison and are undetected
while inside the cloud. The
kraken can’t use Ink
Cloud again for 2d6
rounds, and the cloud
dissipates after 1 minute.
Jet Ȱɵ (move) The kraken

KRAKEN LOCATIONS
A kraken dwells in deep ocean
trenches, sunken cities, or caves
and reefs near hydrothermal vents.
It seeks food near the surface,
however, where it can prey on
seagoing vessels.

KROOTH GUTS
While krooth lairs can contain
valuables in the form of gear
and magic items found on dead
adventurers, the strange enzymes
and other chemicals found in the
internal organs of male krooths,
particularly the liver, pancreas,
and kidneys, are of great value
to alchemists who seek to
concoct elixirs and potions with
transmutation eﬀects. A single
male krooth’s organs, properly
harvested and preserved, can be
sold to an interested alchemist.
Krooth
Krooths, sometimes called crocodile eaters, are fast and vicious hunters of bogs and
wetlands. While they are known to hunt and eat crocodiles, alligators, and virtually
any creature with ﬂesh, their favorite prey are lizardfolk, boggards, and dinosaurs.
Krooths are found alone or in packs. Male krooths are solitary and territorial
creatures—ﬁerce, bold, and bloodthirsty. Female krooths, on the other hand, are
likely to shy away from potential predators but swiftly turn violent when their
brood is threatened. Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths
gather in packs to raise their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food
while the rest of the pack watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4
or 5 years, and the mating process is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire
pack of females will hunt as a group for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize
in an orgiastic frenzy that can last for an entire day and night. After the mating
has ﬁnished, the females slay their mate and devour his nutrient-rich ﬂesh, and
his organs in particular. These organs contain a unique chemical compound vital
to gestation. Many naturalists will pay handsomely for the fresh remains of a
male krooth so they can study the strange properties of the creature’s blood and
organs. In addition, krooths have poisonous, hollow teeth. When these creatures
bite their prey, a tooth breaks off and causes the victim to bleed profusely as their
blood pours through the hollow tooth.
Whether male or female, krooths seem to be repelled by goblinoid ﬂesh,
especially that of bugbears. This doesn’t mean krooths won’t kill goblinoids,
especially those threatening their young, but they typically do so using only
their claws and tails, and they take great care to clean themselves thoroughly
after such a killing.

damaged a creature with its jaws on its most recent
action this turn. Effect The krooth snaps off one of
its teeth in the creature it hit. The creature takes
1d6 persistent bleed damage and is drained 1.
Neither can be healed while the tooth remains.
Removing the tooth safely requires a successful
DC 26 check to Administer First Aid. Instead of
ending bleeding or stabilizing,
this removes the drained
condition, but it doesn’t
automatically end the
bleed damage.

LAMIA TREASURE
Lamias salvage gold, jewels, and
magic items from the abandoned
temples and ruined cities where
they make their lairs. They
sometimes arm themselves with
enchanted daggers.
LAMIA LOCATIONS
Lamias dwell on the edge of
civilization in crumbling keeps,
abandoned cities, and the fallen
temples of forgotten gods.
Lamia
Lamias are bloodthirsty victims of an ancient curse for which they blame the
gods. Most lamias are humanoid from the waist up but have the lower bodies of
beasts and monsters. Sinister magic comes naturally to a lamia, and they prefer
the use of illusions and enchantments to deceive prey for later consumption, or
simply to torture.
Lamia
Just as they were cursed long ago, lamias can curse those they touch, clouding the
mind and regressing conscious thought to purely animalistic instincts. Creatures
affected by this curse grow reckless, becoming unaware of the consequences of
their own actions and unable to think clearly. This makes the hapless victim all
the more susceptible to the lamia’s cunning illusions and insidious charms. The
lamia’s animalistic nature and the effect of their cursed touch has led some scholars
to theorize that the original lamias must have, millennia ago, turned away from
their own reason and intellect and embraced the life of simple beasts. Whether
this change was rewarded as a monstrous gift from Lamashtu or inﬂicted as a
curse for abandoning their responsibilities by Pharasma remains the subject of
debate to this day.
Whatever the source of this ancient transformation, lamias themselves have
grown to enjoy the strengths it has granted them. Regardless, they continue
to cling to a hatred of the gods, seeing them as the cause of their monstrous
forms and, thus, their eternal exile from the societies they watch with
jealous eyes from their lairs amid the ruins of lost civilizations. Because
lamias blame divine powers for their curse, they take special delight
in the downfall of temples, the suffering and death of champions and
clerics, and the spread of dissension within organized religions.
While they can brieﬂy assume humanoid form with magic, lamias
are usually forced to hide from civilization, making their homes in
the barren wilderness. There, they attract cults of their own, gathering
up chaotic and evil humanoids. With the help of these cultists,
lamias strive to bring down popular faiths, introduce schisms
into ﬂourishing churches, and humiliate or defame high-
proﬁle religious leaders. Most lamias themselves have no
true religious faith in anything, hearing instead a mystical
calling that manifests as sighs on the desert wind or
murmurs from the dark places between the stars.
Lamias are traditionally matriarchal, revering
the eldest female among them as leader, mother,
and shaman.

PSYCHOPOMP DIVINITIES
The most powerful of the
psychopomps are unique demigods
known collectively as “ushers,”
each of whom has its own cult.
These psychopomp divinities
include Atropos, the Last Sister;
Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan,
the Shepherd; Dammar, the
Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom;
Mother Vulture, the Flesheater;
Mrtyu, Death’s Consort; Narakas,
the Cleansing Sentence; the
Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler
of Atheists; Saloc, Minder
of Immortals; Teshallas, the
Primordial Poison; and
Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.
Psychopomp
Psychopomps are guardians and shepherds of the dead native to the Boneyard,
the vast plane of graves where mortal souls are judged and sent on to their eternal
rewards or damnations. Psychopomps ensure that the dead come to terms with
their transition from mortality and are properly sorted into the appropriate
afterlife. They also protect souls from being preyed upon by supernatural
predators. Nearly all psychopomps wear masks, especially when they’re likely to
be interacting with mortals, although the types of masks they wear are as varied
as the psychopomps themselves. The courts of the Boneyard preside in Requian, a
somber yet melodic language spoken slowly with various tonal shifts.
Nosoi
A nosoi resembles a whippoorwill, sparrow, or other small bird wearing a heavy
leather plague doctor’s mask. They are the clerks, messengers, and scribes of the
Boneyard, witnessing judgments, directing souls, and generally performing the
administrative grunt work that keeps the Boneyard functioning. Most nosois
are particularly chatty and eager to discuss how important they consider their
individual assignments to be.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The nosoi takes the
appearance of a raven or songbird. This doesn’t change its Speed or its attack and
damage modiﬁers with its Strikes.
Haunting Melody Ȱɵ (auditory, concentrate, divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental)
The nosoi croons an entrancing song. Each living or undead creature within a 60-foot
emanation must attempt a DC 18 Will save. The eﬀect lasts for 1 round, but a nosoi
can use this ability again on subsequent rounds to extend the duration by 1 round for
all aﬀected creatures. A creature that succeeds at any save is temporarily immune
for 24 hours. Despite being a mental eﬀect, this ability aﬀects mindless undead.
Psychopomps are immune to this ability.
Failure The creature is fascinated.
Critical Failure As failure, and the creature must spend each of its actions
on its turn to move closer to the nosoi as expediently as possible while
avoiding obvious dangers. If a fascinated creature is adjacent to the nosoi, it
stays still and doesn’t act. If the creature is attacked, the fascination ends.
Spirit Touch A nosoi’s Strikes aﬀect incorporeal creatures as though etched
with a ghost touch property rune and deal 1d6 negative damage to
living creatures or 1d6 positive damage to undead.
Morrigna
Bounty hunters and investigators, morrignas seek out
creatures that thwart death or interfere with the natural
ﬂow of souls. Morrignas dress in ﬂowing spider silk and
