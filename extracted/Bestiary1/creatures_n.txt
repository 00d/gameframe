plus Grab
Bonds of Iron ʚʖ (attack, conjuration, occult) Once per day, an annis
hag can cause a cage built of cold iron ﬁngernails to spring out of
nothingness at a range of up to 30 feet, attempting an Athletics
check to Grapple against the target’s Fortitude DC; if the target has a
weakness to cold iron, the annis hag gains a +2 circumstance bonus
to this check. Unlike a normal Grapple, the annis hag doesn’t need
to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful
attempt lasts until the creature escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to
crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by
attacking it. It has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The
hag can take on the appearance of any Medium female humanoid. This
doesn’t change her Speed or her attack and damage bonuses with her
Strikes but might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically to
bludgeoning).

Night Hag
Night hags are thieves and merchants of mortal souls.
These foul creatures collect souls in dark gems or
crystalline jars to sell in ﬁendish markets, and are
themselves empowered by potent magic jewels known
as heartstones. They haunt the Ethereal Plane, where
they prey upon mortals in their dreams, debilitating
them with horriﬁc nightmares as they rest. A night
hag may ﬁnd a particular target and haunt them
continuously over the course of weeks, slowly and
cruelly breaking down the victim’s will and ability to
resist, until their soul is forfeit.
A night hag is a canny mastermind and soul broker, willing to
consider any deal as long as she is convinced she has the upper hand.
Although a night hag ﬁnds it easy to travel the Ethereal Plane and
prey upon helpless souls that can’t ﬁght back, these souls are also the
least desirable to the evil outsiders the night hag bargains with, and
so a night hag gathers allies and minions that allow her to prey on
more potent souls without personally risking herself. Their favored
minions are nightmares, with whom they share a special bond.
Above all, night hags avoid ﬁghting foes that can harry them on the Ethereal
Plane, picking ﬁghts only when they are certain they can escape.

Dream Haunting (enchantment, occult, mental) If a night hag is
ethereal and hovering over a sleeping chaotic or evil creature,
she can ride the victim’s back until dawn. The creature

HARPY EXILES
Most harpies are cruel and
sadistic, but now and then a harpy
manages to escape from its family
and becomes exposed to the
wider world. Eyes opened, these
harpy exiles are almost always
more mild-mannered,
cleanly, and open
to non-combat
interactions.
Harpy
Harpies are ﬁlthy amalgamations of human and bird, resembling feral humans
with wings, talons, and mouths full of sharp teeth. They use captivating songs
to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transﬁxed. They enjoy
causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it creates a
savory ﬂavor in the ﬂesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient
prey—humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if
sufﬁciently hungry, they dislike their ﬂavor and avoid eating them if possible. This
doesn’t comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.
Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters
of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with
danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization make better efforts to keep
clean, though these efforts have mixed results.
Harpies live in family groups or larger clans. They
are lightweight despite their size, standing 5 feet tall
and weighing only around 90 pounds. While most use
relatively simple weapons, some harpies take pride in
learning and mastering the use of more complex tools of
war such as swords and slings. Those who master the use of
the bow, in particular, are often regarded as heroes among
their kind and terrors among their victims.

Captivating
Song
Ȱɵ
(auditory,
concentrate,
enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal) The
harpy cries out an eerie, compelling melody. Each
non-harpy creature within a 300-foot aura must attempt
a DC 21 Will save to avoid becoming captivated by the
harpy’s song. The eﬀect lasts for 1 round, but if
the harpy uses this ability again on subsequent
rounds, it extends the duration by 1 round
for all aﬀected creatures. Once a creature
succeeds at any save against Captivating
Song, that creature is temporarily immune
to Captivating Songs for 24 hours.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend each of its actions to move closer to
the harpy as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated
creature is adjacent to the harpy, it stays still and doesn’t act. If attacked by the harpy,
the creature is freed from captivation at the end of the harpy’s turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but if attacked by the harpy, the creature can attempt a new
save at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end of the harpy’s turn.

HOBGOBLINS AND MAGIC
Hobgoblins generally distrust magic,
especially arcane magic, which
they derisively call “elf magic.”
In the absence of magic, they
wholeheartedly embrace alchemy,
combining it with their natural
aptitude for engineering to great
destructive eﬀect. They grudgingly
accept divine magic, due to a
grudging respect for the power of
healing magic in times of war.
Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins may appear to outsiders to be the most civilized of goblinkind, but
their civilization is hardly one of kindness and equality—instead, they revel
in all that is militaristic, tyrannical, cruel, and destructive. Hobgoblins are
singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and
maintaining conﬂict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle.
Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efﬁciently and effectively in
groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or
a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before
declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain slaves or
territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray,
ashen skin.
Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin
is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a
rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and
obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that
they’re fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes
is an individual hobgoblin’s best hope for promotion through the ranks, but
failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though
brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless
of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers
based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat
roles in hobgoblin society—blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers,
quartermasters, and the like—know that they perform vital jobs that
support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the
rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger
whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and
most efﬁcient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so
is culled from the army and this hobgoblin society as
dead weight. Hobgoblins don’t usually engage in trade
with other races, or even with other hobgoblin tribes,
preferring to take what they want by force.
Hobgoblin Soldier
Soldiers make up the bulk of hobgoblin society,
whether that society is a village or a military unit.

INSPIRATIONS FOR ART
Nymphs are living manifestations
of beauty and grace, and as such
they are often the subjects of
art—sculpture and paintings in
particular. Promising a nymph
to immortalize them in a work
of art can be an excellent way to
secure that nymph’s favor, but one
should take care to ensure that the
nymph admires and is proud of the
artistic eﬀort’s ﬁnal result, lest the
nymph be insulted and lash out
with her powerful magic.
Nymph
Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven
features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common
of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many
other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All
nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a speciﬁc tree or pond,
or even—in the case of nymph queens—whole forests or massive bodies of water.
Naiad
Naiads protect streams, ponds, springs, and other natural bodies of fresh water. While
most naiads lead solitary lives close to their chosen ward, sometimes these nymphs
congregate in coven-like groups where river tributaries meet, performing great magic
and blessing the waters of the land. Because naiads’ bonds to their bodies of water
permit more ﬂexibility, they are the nymphs most likely to interact with humanoids
and even visit their settlements on occasion. Unlike other nymphs, naiads occasionally
become adventurers, especially when dark forces seek to despoil nature or otherwise
threaten the land, joining forces with others to prevent the corruption of nature.

Water Dependent A naiad bonds to a spring, pool, pond, or similar-sized water feature.
While within 300 feet of her bonded body of water, she can use her innate tidal surge
at will. She doesn’t recover Hit Points or reduce the drained condition when resting
beyond that range. Unlike most other nymphs, she doesn’t suﬀer penalties from being
apart from her bonded body of water. A naiad can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond
herself to a new body of water.

Water Healing ʚʖ (concentrate, healing, necromancy, primal) While within her bonded
body of water (see water dependent above), the naiad heals 1 Hit Point every 10 minutes.
Dryad
Dryads are fey guardians of the trees and creatures who dwell in wooded areas.
They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their sacred
groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to enlist
the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone. In times
of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at
harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.
Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied
to a speciﬁc tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree
are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to
match their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink
coloration and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.

NYMPH TREASURES
Nymphs sometimes carry magical
trinkets or wear enchanted clothing
or jewelry, but the greatest treasure
a nymph queen can share is often her

save, if the target was already aﬀected by the naiad queen’s beauty, the image of the
queen sears into the creature’s mind, allowing no further sight and eﬀectively blinding
the creature until restored via restore senses or a similar eﬀect, or until the naiad queen
chooses to remove the eﬀect using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.

Dryad Queen (Hamadryad)
Hamadryads rule over an entire forest, or a portion of an incredibly large
forest, leading and protecting all dryads within. Hamadryads often have
strange relationships with powerful and deadly fey, working together
in a dualistic way despite their differences, with the
hamadryad representing nature’s wonders and the other
fey representing nature’s wrath.

ANCIENT IMMORTALS
Among the numerous types
of immortals that dwell in the
Great Beyond, the proteans
are surely some of the oldest.
They’ve waged war against the
inevitable aeons from the advent
of their ﬁrst creation, and speak
longingly of that time before the
gods themselves imposed order
upon reality.

Melee Ȱɵ tentacle +18 (agile, chaotic, magical, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8+6 piercing

Divine Innate Spells DC 26, attack +16; 5th dimension door; 4th acid arrow, solid fog; 3rd
shatter(at will); 2nd obscuring mist (at will); 1st detect alignment (at will; lawful only);
Constant (4th) freedom of movement
Adaptive Strike Ȳ˓ (divine, polymorph, transmutation) The naunet chooses adamantine,
cold iron, or silver; its melee Strikes count as that type for 1 minute or until it uses
Adaptive Strike again.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentration, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The naunet can
take the appearance of any Small, Medium, or Large animal, beast, or humanoid. This
doesn’t change its Speed or its attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes but might
change the damage type its Strikes deal.
Confounding Slam (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) A creature hit by the naunet’s
tentacle Strike is stupeﬁed 2 for 1d4 rounds (DC 24 Will negates). If the creature
was already stupeﬁed in this way, the duration extends by 1 round instead. A chaotic
creature is only stupeﬁed 1 instead.
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d8+8 bludgeoning, DC 26
Keketar
The ruling caste of the proteans, keketars orchestrate attacks against the bastions
of law and adjudicate protean disputes conﬁdently and capriciously. A keketar
resembles a shimmering, serpentine creature with spines, claws, and
a dragon-like head. A keketar’s actual appearance is in constant
ﬂux, but they generally stay about 18 feet long with a
weight of around 1,500 pounds. While their physical
forms can vary, two things remain constant: First,
a keketar’s eyes are always a piercing shade of
amber or violet. Second, the keketar’s mark of
ofﬁce—a crown of shifting symbols that hovers
above its head—never changes. A keketar cannot
remove its crown but can suppress it, although most
are loath to do so and consider such an act one of
cowardice or shame.
Keketars ﬁll a role in protean society of a
sort of priesthood, operating as intermediaries
between the other proteans and the Speakers of
the Depths. All other proteans defer to keketars,
treating them in a way similar to how citizens
of a mortal city would treat respected nobles;
even more powerful proteans defer to the will
of the keketars. As with many religions, dogma and
theology are prone to interpretation and change, and
among the proteans the situation is perhaps even
more pronounced. Whatever the nature of and
desires held by the mysterious Speakers of
the Depths, individual keketars may come
to dramatically different conclusions as to
their will and intent. To the proteans,
though, this inherent dissonance is
a strength rather than a weakness.

DEFENDING CHAOS
Where proteans go, chaos follows.
To proteans, there is no purer form
of existence than entropy, and
they constantly seek to oppose
the establishment of order in the
Great Beyond. However, proteans
don’t see life as being incompatible
with chaos; rather, they simply
believe beings—immortal or
not—deserve complete
freedom on their
own terms.

hallucinatory terrain, it infuses the illusion

not disbelieve the illusion treat structures and
terrain created through the spell as though
they were real, ascending illusory stairs,
becoming trapped by illusory quicksand, and
so on.

A creature struck by a keketar’s jaws or claw Strike must
succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be subject to a warpwave
(page 266).

Change
Shape
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
divine,
polymorph, transmutation) A morrigna can take the appearance of
any Small or Medium animal or humanoid. This doesn’t change their
Speed or their attack and damage modiﬁers with their Strikes, but it
might change the damage type their Strikes deal. Unless they choose
to manifest their web wrappings in their new form, they cannot make
web wrappings Strikes.
Spider Minions ̂ˬ (conjuration, divine) The morrigna summons a giant
tarantula (page 307) or spider swarm (page 306). These spiders have
the summoned trait and remain for 10 minutes or until reduced to 0 Hit
Points, whichever comes ﬁrst. The morrigna does not need to Sustain
the Spell to direct these summoned creatures, and the morrigna can
have any number of summoned spiders in existence at once. The
morrigna can see through the eyes of any of their
summoned spiders at any time.
Spirit Touch As nosoi, but 4d6.
