ARCHDEVILS
At any one time, eight archdevils
rule the eight upper layers of Hell,
while the deepest layer is ruled
by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a
unique demigod with a dedicated
role in guiding the infernal machine
forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden
of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while
Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city.
Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries,
and Belial designs new weapons
for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the
oldest archdevil and keeper of many
secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs
armies. Baalzebul is a brooding
archdevil who has fallen from
Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty
Mephistopheles was formed from
the plane of Hell itself.
Imp
Imps are inﬁltrators and corruptors who, despite their diminutive stature, are
more than capable of subtly inﬂuencing a weak-willed individual into performing
increasingly evil acts over time. An imp will often agree to serve a mortal and
act docile and loyal in a long-term plot to eventually damn its master’s soul to
Hell. Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal souls, and
thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them leeway to
pursue their specialties. Despite standing a mere 2-feet tall, imps can be vicious
combatants, ﬂying out of reach and turning invisible to escape should the odds
turn against them.

or resurrected except by wish or similar magic. Once during the hour, the
creature can roll an attack roll or saving throw twice and use the higher result.

FIENDISH RELATIONS
Devils view daemonsʼ constant
hunt for souls as a short-sighted
waste of potential, and demonsʼ
chaotic destruction of society
and ﬂesh as uncivilized and
obnoxious, but they do not loathe
their ﬁendish counterparts.
Indeed, most devils are more
than willing to take advantage
of daemons and demons as they
can to further their
own machinations.
Barbazu (Bearded Devil)
Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous ﬁends
who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers of Hell’s
armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures into
battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inﬂict jagged gashes that resist
healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too
close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver
a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim’s
strength being slowly devoured from within.
Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords
from all layers of Hell, rejoicing as they
disseminate murder, misery, and anguish
as they see ﬁt.

persistent bleed damage that resists attempts to heal it. The ﬂat check to stop the
bleeding starts at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding creature or
an ally successfully assists with the recovery.
The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an infernal
wound is increased by 5. A spellcaster or item attempting to
use healing magic on a creature suﬀering from an infernal
wound must succeed at a DC 21 counteract check or the
magic fails to heal the creature.

Strike. Eﬀect The devil moves the creature 5 feet in any
direction. The destination square must be within reach of the
devil’s glaive. This movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
Wriggling Beard Ȱɵ Frequency once per round. Eﬀect The barbazu makes a beard
Strike. This Strike ignores their multiple attack penalty and doesn’t count toward
that penalty.

PRIMAL ELEMENTALS
The most well known of all
elementals are the primal
elementals, creatures composed
entirely of air, earth, ﬁre, or water
with roughly humanoid shapes.
Many primal elementals are
named after natural disasters,
ranging from those relatively
small in scale (and roughly the
size of Medium humanoids) to
much larger ones (often the
size of small buildings). Primal
elementals can often be found
in areas where their namesake
disasters have recently struck.
Naturally Invisible The invisible stalker is invisible at all times, though when it takes
a hostile action of any kind, it is hidden instead of undetected until the start of its
next turn, as the vague outline of its humanoid form is faintly visible for a short
period of time.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +18 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 1d10+5 bludgeoning
Sneak Attack The invisible stalker deals 2d6 extra precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
Swift Tracker The invisible stalker moves at full Speed while Tracking.

Storm lords wage battles to claim important territory within the Plane of Air.

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (air) The elemental breathes a 30-foot cone of air. Creatures in
the cone must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be knocked away from the
elemental. A creature knocked into a solid object stops moving and takes 10d6
bludgeoning damage. The elemental hurricane can’t use Breath Weapon again for
1d4 rounds.

ADAMANTINE GOLEMS
The incredible amount of
adamantine necessary to create
a single adamantine golem is
worth more than many nations’
treasuries. The powerful heart
of an adamantine golem can be
turned into a legendary forge for
blacksmithing.

HP 255, repair mode; Immunities bleed, death eﬀects, disease, doomed, drained,
fatigued, ﬁre, healing, magic (see below), mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks,
paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious; Resistances physical 20 (except vorpal
adamantine)
Golem Antimagic harmed by acid (9d10, 2d10 from areas or persistent damage);
healed by ﬁre (area 2d10 HP); slowed by electricity
Repair Mode When the adamantine golem is at 0 HP, it isn’t destroyed. Instead,
it enters repair mode, during which it is slowed 1, can’t take reactions, and can
take only the Self-Repair action. Once it has more than 30 HP, it can use any type
of action and can use reactions, though it remains slowed 1 and can’t take any
reactions until the start of its next turn. If a critical hit with an adamantine vorpal
weapon reduces the golem to 0 HP, or if such a weapon hits it while it’s already at
0 HP, then the golem is destroyed.
Vulnerable to Dispelling The golem can be targeted by disjunction and dispel magic.
If targeted by such a spell of 9th level or higher, the golem has its resistance to
physical damage lowered to 15 and is slowed 1 (or slowed 2 if in repair mode) for
1d4 rounds. During this time, if the golem is reduced to 0 HP while
already in repair mode, it is destroyed.
Speed 30 feet
Melee Ȱɵ fist +35 (deadly 3d12, magical, reach 15 feet),
Damage 3d10+17 bludgeoning plus destructive
strike
Destructive Strike On a critical hit, the adamantine
golem’s fist Strike breaks the target’s armor,
if any, in addition to dealing damage to the
target. If the target has a shield raised,
the golem breaks the shield instead.
Inexorable March Ȱɵ The adamantine
golem Strides up to its Speed,
pushing back each creature
whose space it moves into and
damaging them if they try to
stop its movement. A creature can
try to bar the way by attempting a DC 45
Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature takes no damage
and its armor takes no damage.
Success The golem halts its movement and
cannot enter the creature’s square.
Failure The resisting creature is damaged
and its armor takes damage as if hit by
the adamantine golem’s ﬁst.
Self-Repair
Ȱɵ
(manipulate)
The
golem repairs itself, regaining 30
Hit Points.
Vent Ȱɵ (fire) The golem vents a 30-
foot cone of superheated steam from
its internal forge. This deals 15d6 fire
damage to all creatures in the cone (DC
40 basic Reflex). The golem can't use Vent
again for 1d6 rounds.

OTHER LINNORMS
Linnorms exist in a variety of
forms beyond the four detailed
here. The gaunt cairn linnorm,
the spiny taiga linnorm, and
the aquatic fjord linnorm each
terrorize their own specific
regions of the Material Plane.
Tarn Linnorm
Although more powerful linnorms exist, the multi-headed tarn linnorm can wreak
an awe-inspiring amount of devastation.

such as healing spells, the Medicine skill, or natural healing from rest.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Tail only.

Improved Grab
Primal Innate Spells DC 42; Constant (9th) freedom of
movement; (8th) true seeing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (acid, evocation, poison, primal) The
tarn linnorm can expel either a 120-foot line or a 60-foot
cone of acid dealing 20d6 acid damage to creatures
within the area (DC 44 basic Reﬂex save). The acid
creates toxic fumes. At the beginning of the linnorm’s
next turn, those who failed the breath weapon’s
Reﬂex save must succeed at a DC 42 Fortitude save
or gain sickened 4 from the poisonous fumes. A
tarn linnorm can’t use Breath Weapon or Overwhelming
Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
Constrict Ȱɵ 3d6+18 bludgeoning, DC 44
Double Bite Ȱɵ The tarn linnorm Strides and then makes a
jaws Strike with each of its heads, each against a different
target. These attacks count toward the tarn linnorm’s
multiple attack penalty, and the multiple attack penalty
doesn’t increase until after the tarn linnorm makes all of
these attacks.
Overwhelming Breath ̂ˬ A tarn
linnorm uses its Breath Weapon
twice. A creature attempts only
one save and can take damage
only once. The tarn linnorm
can’t use Breath Weapon or
Overwhelming Breath again for
2d4 rounds.
Tarn Linnorm Venom (acid, injury,
poison) Saving Throw DC 44
Fortitude; Maximum Duration 10
rounds; Stage 1 7d6 acid damage
