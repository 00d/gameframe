Wyvern
A wyvern is a venomous drake with a well-earned reputation for impatience and
aggression. As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern’s
resilient body allows it to crash talons-ﬁrst into large prey without serious risk
to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with
searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks
the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to
lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before
it descends to pick apart the carcass.
Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature
typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or
demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and
tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by
the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment,
and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging
from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful
humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a
few weeks before the wyvern’s pride, malice, or insolence inspires
it to ﬂee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a
wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns
are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid
helping others.

ARE WYVERNS DRAKES?
Although commonly classiﬁed as
drakes, wyverns exhibit signiﬁcant
diﬀerences from most other types
of drakes. While scholars debate
the precise relationship between
them, none dispute that they
exhibit collegial behavior and
general deference to one another.

Frost Drake
Frost drakes pose an immense danger in the frozen reaches they call home,
where they roam far and wide to hunt for prey such as caribou, wolves, small
bears, and tundra-dwelling people. Related as they are to white dragons, these
drakes share many habits and facets of their disposition with their draconic
cousins. Indeed, just as white dragons are among the most bestial and craven of
dragonkind, frost drakes are among the most depraved and openly malicious
of the drakes. They are also especially insolent, and are less likely to back
down from a ﬁght compared to other drakes. Many frost drakes have met their
ends trying to enact cruelties beyond their means, such as singly taking on an
entire castle or well-fortiﬁed township. Although a frost drake can wreak much
destruction on its own, tales of village-dwelling northerners banding together to
defend their homes from these rogue menaces are fairly common.
A frost drake’s hunting grounds are quite large. Those frost drakes that live
upon the permanently frozen peaks of high mountains have been known to
swoop down to snatch up prey from the lowlands, leaving frozen swaths of earth
from their breath as the only sign of their passing. Their frost-covered scales range
from deep royal blue to crisp cyan and sometimes feature sporadic patches of
violet. Their hides are thinner than most drakes’; when a frost drake is inhaling
in preparation to launch its signature frozen breath, the monster’s ice-blue blood
can be seen beneath its scales.

of liquid up to 60 feet that explodes
into a 20-foot-burst cloud of freezing
mist. Those in the burst take 8d6 cold
damage (DC 25 basic Reﬂex save). The mist
cakes all surfaces in the area with a sheet of
slippery ice that turns the area into diﬃcult
terrain for 2d4 rounds. It can’t use Freezing Mist
Breath again for 1d6 rounds.
Ice Climb A frost drake can climb on ice as though
it had the listed climb Speed. It ignores diﬃcult terrain
and greater diﬃcult terrain from ice and snow and doesn’t
risk falling when crossing ice.
Speed Surge Ȱɵ (move) The frost drake moves up to
twice its Speed. It can do this three times per day.
DRAKE RESOURCES
While every adventurer knows
that dragon hide can be crafted
into potent armor or weapons,
drake hide holds no such intrinsic
value. Nonetheless, drake
scales and horns are physically
impressive, and to the uneducated
buyer, might seem at ﬁrst glance
to be legitimate. Unscrupulous
leatherworkers have been known
to use drake hides to craft and
sell counterfeit dragonhide
armor, so potential buyers
should remain on the
lookout for scams.

OTHER ELEMENTALS
When energies from elemental
planes mix, unusual elemental life
can form. The combination of ﬁre
and earth, for example, can spawn
magma elementals, while air and
water can create ice elementals.
Lightning elementals form from a
conjunction of ﬁre and air, while
water and earth give birth to mud
elementals. It’s possible that in
the vastness of the Great Beyond,
even more unusual elementals
might exist, although they are as
rare as they are strange.
Elemental, Water
Water elementals can be very destructive, but often not intentionally so; just as
water can bring life to those in need on the Material Plane, its waves can pound
shores and rains can ﬂood cities. Water elementals are similarly difﬁcult to predict.
Brine Shark
Brine sharks are deadly elementals that roam the endless oceans of the Plane of Water.

widely feared for their regeneration abilities.

Skills Athletics +17, Stealth +12 (+15 in water)
Str +7, Dex +4, Con +5, Int –3, Wis +2, Cha –1
AC 23; all-around vision; Fort +15, Ref +12, Will +10
HP (body) 90, hydra regeneration
HP (head) 15, head regrowth; Immunities area damage; Weaknesses slashing 5
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Head Regrowth A hydra ordinarily has ﬁve heads. A creature can attempt to sever one of
the hydra’s heads by speciﬁcally targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head’s
Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end
of any creature’s turn.
A hydra can regrow a severed head using Hydra Regeneration. A creature can prevent
this regrowth by dealing acid or ﬁre damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target
acid or ﬁre eﬀects need to be targeted at a speciﬁc stump, but eﬀects that deal splash
damage or aﬀect areas covering the hydra’s whole space cauterize all stumps if they
deal acid or ﬁre damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any acid or ﬁre damage,
the stump is cauterized instantly. If all ﬁve heads are cauterized, the hydra dies.
Hydra Regeneration The hydra has regeneration equal to 3 × the number of heads it has. If
a hydra’s body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized,
the hydra attempts a DC 25 Fortitude save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration.
On a success, one uncauterized stump regrows two heads; on a critical success, two
uncauterized stumps regrow into two heads each. The hydra can never grow more
than double the number of heads it ordinarily has. The hydra’s regeneration only fully
deactivates if all its heads are severed and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it dies.
Multiple Opportunities A hydra gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads
beyond the ﬁrst, which it can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity. It can’t use
more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several
squares within its reach, and the hydra must use a diﬀerent head for
each Attack of Opportunity it makes. Whenever one of the
hydra’s heads is severed, the hydra loses 1
of its extra reactions per round.
Speed 25 feet, swim 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ fangs +16 (reach 10 feet), Damage
2d6+7 piercing
Focused
Assault
ʚʖ
The
hydra
attacks a single target with its heads,
overwhelming its foe with multiple
attacks and leaving almost nowhere to
dodge. The hydra Strikes with its fangs.
On a successful attack, the hydra deals damage from its
fangs Strike to the target, plus an additional 1d6 damage
for every head it has beyond the ﬁrst. Even on a failed
attack, the hydra deals the damage from one fangs Strike
to the target creature, though it still misses completely on
a critical failure. This counts toward the hydra’s multiple
attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of
heads the hydra has.
Storm of Jaws ʚʖ The hydra makes a number of Strikes up to
its number of heads, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks
count toward the hydra’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty
doesn’t increase until after the hydra makes all its attacks.
VARIANT HYDRAS
Scholars of bestial lore can
describe several hydra variations.
Though rare, hydras with more
than ﬁve heads live in very
isolated areas, sometimes guarding
incredibly powerful artifacts.
Explorers who have visited colder
swamps and frozen glaciers tell
tales of hydras with blue-tinged
scales that are immune to the
cold and can exhale clouds of icy
death. Similar stories describe
ﬁery hydras that breathe gouts of
ﬂame and swim in the molten lava
of active volcanoes.

ALTERNATE WARSWORNS
While uniquely terrible, war is not
the only tragedy that can lead to
mass deaths. Other forms of mass
undead, similar to warsworn, can
sometimes arise from causes such
as famine or disaster. Flamesworn
rise from large crowds killed by
ﬁre, while plagueborn rise when
entire townships or even cities
perish to disease.
Warsworn
A warsworn is an animate mass of corpses composed of dozens, sometimes
even hundreds, of victims of battle. They are formed by deities of undeath or
war or, rarely, spontaneously manifest from the devastation of an especially
horrendous battle.

into itself, instantly killing the creature and
healing the warsworn for a number of Hit Points
equal to the creature’s level. As long as the
warsworn still exists, absorbed creatures
can’t be resurrected except by wish or a
similarly powerful eﬀect.
Animated Weapons (divine, evocation); The warsworn
assumes control of unattended weapons within
100 feet, forcing them to levitate around it. The
warsworn can telekinetically wield these weapons to
make melee Strikes with a reach of 100 feet.
Energy Drain (divine, necromancy); When a warsworn hits with a corpse wave Strike
or damages a creature with Trample, the target must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save
or become drained 2 and doomed 1. On a critical
success, the target becomes temporarily
immune to the warsworn’s energy drain for
24 hours.
Plummet A creature hit by a warsworn’s scrap ball
Strike must attempt a DC 37 Reﬂex save. On a
failure, the target falls prone;
if the target was airborne,
it falls up to 120 feet, taking
damage from the fall and
landing prone if the descent
brings it to the ground. On a
critical failure, the target is
also held under a pile of scrap
(DC 37 to Escape).

SACRED STINGERS
Wasps are upheld as sacred
among the priesthood of the
elven deity Calistria, goddess
of vengeance. Some priests of
Calistria summon giant wasps or
wasp swarms as servitors, while a
few nurture giant wasps as pets,
temple guardians, or companions.
Followers of Calistria, both
clergy and laypeople alike, seek
to emulate the wasp’s penchant
for leaving stung victims alive to
suﬀer over a long period: a ﬁtting
model for revenge.
PARALYTIC POISON
The poison of the giant wasp
loses its potency soon after being
harvested, but alchemists have
learned of a way to preserve
some of its properties by adding
a number of harsh additives; this
method makes it even deadlier.
Wasp
While the common wasp poses little threat to a hardy adventurer aside from
an uncomfortable sting, a large and aggressive swarm of these territorial
insects—to say nothing of their oversized kin—can lay low an entire party
of heroes. The wasps represented here are of the common variety also known
as yellowjackets, but many other sorts of dangerous wasps exist, such as a
Garundi variant that swarms in such great numbers that it can decimate entire
villages, and the dreaded extraplanar hellwasps, which build their nests within
the corpses of their victims.
Giant Wasp
Giant wasps are much more dangerous but less common than their smaller kin,
and—to the relief of those who encounter them—they tend to be solitary.

Wasp nests are made of chewed wood ﬁbers foraged from
the surrounding ﬂora, which the wasps make into a material
similar to paper. A single wasp nest can house thousands
of individuals that emerge as a massive swarm. Most
swarms attack only to protect their nest or if otherwise
agitated, though druids and other primal enchanters
can bend these venomous vermin to their will—to deadly effect.

WEMMUTH TREASURE
Wemmuths have little interest
in using magical items or
accumulating treasure out of a
sense of greed, but are smart
enough to understand that a few
well-placed trinkets and baubles
work amazingly well as lures.
Wemmuth
Fertilized by large quantities of spilled blood, such as that found on bloodstained
battleﬁelds or in the war-torn regions surrounding besieged cities, wemmuths
are vile swaths of vines that draw sustenance from mortal suffering, lapping up
blood like water. Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable
thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to
incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that
comprise a wemmuth’s body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult
wemmuth system consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet
if stretched from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient
themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into
massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. Although
wemmuths are often spotted lazing about, the scent of blood is enough to whip
one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere
of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of
an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from
the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to
bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling them at faraway
foes with terrifying precision.
Some speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let
loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a
scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Inﬂuential nobles from
Nirmathas and Molthune both point ﬁngers at one another for
the wemmuth’s creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune’s
close ties to Infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming
the primal magic commonly employed by
Nirmathas’s many druids and rangers. Several
Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching
the wemmuth’s description attempting to
apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders
from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths
were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari,
former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the
hands of mortal heroes.

WENDIGO WORSHIP
Some humanoids who dwell in
arctic regions oﬀer tribute to
wendigos that hunt near their
villages, treating them as gods
or spirits of nature that must
be appeased. They occasionally
perform rites of cannibalism and
place fetishes throughout the
wilderness to mark the
wendigo’s domain.
Wendigo
Wendigos are incarnations of the fears of starvation, loneliness, and fatal exposure
to cold weather. They haunt the frozen expanses of the world.

̂ˬ
(auditory,

Eﬀect The wendigo unleashes a forlorn howl that can be heard up
to 1 mile away. Any creature that hears the howl must succeed at a DC
38 Will save or be frightened 1. Any creature that critically fails and is
within 120 feet of the wendigo is instead frightened 3, and is also ﬂeeing
for 1d4 rounds (or until it’s no longer frightened, whichever comes ﬁrst). A
creature frightened by a wendigo’s howl still naturally recovers from its fright
but can’t reduce it below frightened 1 in this way until 1 hour has passed or magic is
used. Whether it succeeds or fails its save, a creature is then temporarily immune to
that wendigo’s Howl for 24 hours.
Ride the Wind Ǻȓ (air, concentrate, primal, transmutation); Trigger The wendigo
casts wind walk while it has Grabbed a foe. Eﬀect The wendigo attempts
to turn the grabbed creature into wind and carry it along as part of the
action. If the target succeeds at a DC 38 Will save, it prevents itself
from being transformed; in this case, the wendigo still transforms,
automatically releasing the victim. A creature forced to Ride
the Wind along with the wendigo is exposed to wendigo
torment. The target can attempt a new Will save each
round to return to normal, though it immediately becomes
corporeal and begins falling if it succeeds.
Wendigo Torment (curse, enchantment, mental,
primal) A creature aﬀected by wendigo
torment can’t recover beyond stage 1 until it
has been restored to full HP. Saving Throw
Will DC 38; Stage 1 Stupeﬁed 4 (1 day); Stage 2
As stage 1 (1 day); Stage 3 The creature searches
for an individual of its own ancestry to kill and devour.
It then becomes aﬀected by wind walk and sprints into the sky so fast that its feet burn
away into jagged stumps. As the creature wind walks into the sky, it is replaced by a
new wendigo over 2d6 minutes. Wish, similar magic, or a 9th-level resurrect ritual can
return the victim to life. The new wendigo remains even if the victim is resurrected.

BUILDING
WERECREATURES
The curse of the werecreature
comes in myriad forms and can
aﬀect any humanoid, allowing
you to make a wide variety of
werecreatures for your adventures.
When you need to create a
werecreature for your game, you
can do so in one of two ways. You
can simply build the werecreature
from the ground up, using the
standard rules for monster
creation (this is how the werebear,
wererat, and werewolf presented
on these pages were built). Or you
can use the guidelines presented
under “Creating Werecreatures”
to turn an existing creature (or
even a player character!) into
a werecreature. In either case,
speciﬁc werecreature abilities
like Change Shape, curse of the
werecreature, and moon frenzy
work the same.
Werecreature
Werecreatures are humanoids doomed to transform into animals and animal-
humanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. These shapechanging creatures
are the result of an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through
their own bites. Their ability to lurk unseen in the wilds as well as among people,
combined with the contagiousness of their condition, makes werecreatures a
perennial cause of panicked suspicion.
Afflicted and True Werecreatures
Werecreatures come in two types: those afﬂicted with the curse and those born
with it (“true werecreatures”).
One can be born a true werecreature to any werecreature parent. A true
werecreature is always a werecreature and retains the same memories and most
of the same statistics in all forms. A true werecreature also has full control over its
shapechanging except during the full moon, when the transformation is irresistible.
There is no known way to break the curse on a true werecreature.
Affected werewolves received their curse from the bite of another werecreature
(which could’ve been an afﬂicted or true werecreature). An afﬂicted werecreature
may be unaware of its curse because it retains no memories of its transformations,
gets no beneﬁt from being a werecreature when not transformed, and has no
conscious control over its transformation. An afﬂicted werecreature’s curse can be
removed like any other.
Creating Werecreatures
You can turn an existing, living humanoid into a werecreature by completing the
following steps. (These changes reﬂect a werecreature in its hybrid form.)
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 It gains the beast and werecreature traits, and its alignment is usually
adjusted to match that of its werecreature type.
•	 Increase its size by one category if the animal is a larger size than the
base humanoid.
•	 Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 1.
•	 Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the
werecreature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath
weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase its HP by the amount shown on the table. This HP increase is more
than typical in order to compensate for the creature’s weakness to silver.
•	 The creature gains weakness to silver as shown on the table.

WERECREATURE AbILITIES
All werecreatures gain the following abilities, some of which match an ability of
the animal the werecreature transforms into. You might also need to adjust some
abilities that conﬂict with the theme of the werecreature (such as abilities with a
conﬂicting alignment trait).
Senses The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal.
Animal Empathy (divination, primal) A werecreature can communicate with animals of
the same general kind.
Claws The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing
damage). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly
the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its
claws should deal three-quarters that damage.

Appendix
RETAINING HUMANITY
Werecreatures are notorious for
their murderous rampages in the
deep of the night—violence that is
often at odds with the aﬄicted’s
true nature. Even an honorable
town guard or priest could be
a murderous werewolf without
realizing it, for the werecreature’s
curse leaves the aﬄicted with
no memory of their nocturnal
murder sprees.
Jaws The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage)
that inﬂicts its curse of the werecreature. If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage
dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If
it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature
changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a speciﬁc,
persistent appearance. A true werecreature’s natural form is its hybrid shape. In
humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and
claws Strikes, and gains a melee ﬁst Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to
the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to
that of the animal, it gains any special Strike eﬀects of the animal that it didn’t already
have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes.
Curse of the Werecreature (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse aﬀects only humanoids.
Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the standard DC for the werecreature’s new level – 1. On
each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into
the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM’s control and
goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.
Moon Frenzy (polymorph, primal, transmutation) When a full moon appears in the
night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can’t Change Shape thereafter,
becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of
its jaws by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature
returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours.
Wererat
Wererats tend to be selﬁshly opportunistic, avaricious, and
paranoid as a result of their curse. Because wererats
typically dwell in metropolitan areas where they can
hide in plain sight, practically any city-goer could be a
wererat in disguise—from the quiet shopkeep to the
city’s criminal mastermind. The bustle of crowds and
countless rat-holes make ghettos and shantytowns
favored homes for wererats, especially since in these
poorer districts the wererat can kill out of greed or
fear with little chance of the authorities noticing. In
some cities, wererats operate entire thieves’ guilds
or organized crime rings, and membership requires
willfully submitting to the wererat’s cursed bite. Wererats look very
similar to ratfolk when in hybrid form, apart from potential
differences in size, but ratfolk have no love for these monsters.

Sneak Attack The wererat deals 1d6 extra precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
Werewolf
The curse of the werewolf—known as lycanthropy to many—instills in its carriers the
hungry bloodlust and predatory instincts of the wolf. Werewolves tend to dwell on the
fringes of society or in small settlements where, in their humanoid forms, they work
as laborers, hunters, farmers, or trappers. At night, however, these same villagers
transform into violent killers and sadistic stalkers who prey on their neighbors.
Werewolves are the quintessential werecreature, and the ﬁrst that comes to mind
when most people speak of such beings.
Although most werewolves hide their curse by adopting
solitary lifestyles, some retain the pack mentality of true
wolves. A small group of such werewolves typically
forms a family-like pack, with the eldest or most
powerful serving as the leader; new pack mates are
hand-chosen and inculcated into the family as its
inﬂuence grows.

Werebear
Unlike many other types of werecreature, a werebear does not become
malevolent during its involuntary transformations, but is instead ﬁlled with
WOLFSBANE
Wolfsbane (Core Rulebook 553)
is a poisonous plant that can cure
the curse of the werecreature. It’s
eﬀective only if consumed before the
creature transforms for the ﬁrst time.
If the creature survives wolfsbane’s
eﬀects without using magic to aid in
surviving, the creature can attempt
a new saving throw against the
curse of the werecreature. On a
success, the creature is cured.

righteous conviction. This indignation can still manifest in violent ways, though,
as a transformed werebear becomes temporarily blind to its alliances and has
little control over its bestial temper. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely
even living together as families longer than necessary. Werebears know that as
long as they live solitary lives, they can serve as protectors and guardians in
wilderness regions without the overwhelming fear that, when the moon is full
and the curse takes hold, they will rage against an innocent bystander or loved
one. As long as there is nothing around to threaten it or the natural area it
protects (typically a forest), a werebear in its animal form is generally content
to forage and sleep away the night.

werecreature, provided the animal
in question is at least omnivorous—
herbivorous werecreatures are all
but unheard of. Werecreatures that
rise from insects, arachnids, and
similar invertebrate animals are
particularly unsettling, though much
rarer than werecreatures
of vertebrate animals.

OTHER WIGHTS
In addition to the wight presented
here, many other varieties exist.
For example, the covetous cairn
wight—ritually created to eternally
guard its own wealth or that of its
master—haunts barrows, ossuaries,
and mausoleums. Unlike other
wights, cairn wights can channel
their life-draining touch through
their melee weapons.
Wight
Wights are undead humanoids that, much like wraiths, can drain the life from
living creatures with but a touch. They arise as a result of necromantic rituals,
especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased.
As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be
created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for
different wights with different niches to ﬁll. Environment, too, plays a part in
determining a wight’s special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances,
can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end.
Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places
of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals
who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled
to “free” to the state of undeath.
A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb.
Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single
wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde
of these undead. Thus, canny
priests and adventurers know
that the best solution to a
wight problem is swift and
total eradication. Care
must be taken, though,
to destroy wight spawn
before attempting to destroy
the parent wight, for spawn without a master
gain the ability to create spawn of their own.
Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy,
wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the
way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain
passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades
or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses
them from their rest.

increases the amount of drain by 1 on a failed save to a maximum of drained 4.

as a wight after 1d4 rounds. This wight spawn is under the command of the wight
that killed it. It doesn’t have Drain Life or Wight Spawn and becomes clumsy 2 for as
long as it is a wight spawn. If the creator of the wight spawn dies, the wight spawn
becomes a full-ﬂedged, autonomous wight; it regains its free will, gains Drain Life and
Wight Spawn, and is no longer clumsy.

EYES OF THE DEAD
The elder goddess Nhimbaloth,
the so-called "Empty Death," is
said by many to be the source
of all will‑o’‑wisps. Cultists of
Nhimbaloth claim she has no true
form, but is merely a presence
that can be felt by all in danger
of a pointless and futile death.
These same cultists maintain that
all will‑o’‑wisps are Nhimbaloth’s
eyes, and it is through these
fear‑devouring creatures that she
looks upon all worlds from an
eldritch realm beyond even the
very concept of death.
Will-o’-Wisp
Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o’-wisps haunt lonely marshes and forests
where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o’-wisps can vary the
color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns
or distant ﬁres to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can
extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing
so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light
in the distance isn’t, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a
will-o’-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and
dread felt by its victims.
Beneath its glow, a will-o’-wisp’s body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in
diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o’-wisps are merely
translucent, featureless orbs, gaining deﬁnition only in the shifting illumination
they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when
viewed closely. Will-o’-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact
lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they ﬁnd all the sustenance they
need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside
undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o’-wisps are long-lived, if not
effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-
o’-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such
cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.
Will-o’-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active
at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into
immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their
victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches
of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o’-wisps, different
types of fear have subtle differences in ﬂavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the
stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they’re
lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent
death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o’-wisps try to vary
the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don’t tire of
certain ﬂavors of fear.

wisp feeds on the creature’s terror. It regains 2d4 Hit Points, and if
it has Gone Dark, its glow reignites. A will-o’-wisp can take this action
only once per round.
Go Dark Ȱɵ (concentrate) The will-o’-wisp extinguishes its glow, becoming invisible.
It can end this eﬀect with another use of this action. If it uses its shock attack while
invisible, the arc of electricity lets any observer determine its location, making the
will-o’-wisp only hidden to all observers until it moves.

WOLF PACKS
Wolf packs claim and defend large
swaths of territory, which they
regularly patrol in search of both
prey and competitors. It takes a
pack roughly 10 days to cover
the entire breadth of its territory,
which can stretch for miles in any
direction but usually adheres to
natural terrain. Wolves keep claim
over their territories by marking
trees with their scent and howling
to keep other packs away. If these
warnings prove insuﬃcient to
drive oﬀ potential competitors, the
pack attacks the intruders directly.
Wolf
Wolves roam forests, hills, and other wild lands, where they hunt in packs to
beleaguer and surround their prey before going in for the kill. Like most predatory
animals, wolves prefer to attack the weakest or most vulnerable prey they can ﬁnd.
Wolf
Wolves live and hunt in packs, which, contrary to popular belief, are not led by
the strongest in the group, but typically consist of a mated pair, their pups, and
juvenile offspring from previous mating seasons. Offspring generally leave their
parents’ pack upon reaching maturity, at which point they seek out mates of their
own to go form their own packs elsewhere.
Humanoids are not traditionally viewed as prey animals by wolves, but
extraordinary circumstances can lead these animals to attack people, especially in
winter months and other situations where traditional prey (deer and elk, mainly)
is scarce. Some beings, such as powerful vampires, can call upon wolves to aid
them in combat.

XULGATH TREASURE
Xulgaths are relatively primitive,
using tools and weapons of stone
and other materials scavenged
from the surface. These can
replicate most simple and a few
martial melee weapons, as well as
simple thrown ranged weapons.
An advanced tribe of xulgaths
might be able to craft low-level
magical talismans, such as a
potency crystal or a
returning clasp.
Xulgath
Reptilian humanoids who live in the uppermost reaches of the Darklands, xulgaths
(known as troglodytes to many surface-dwelling folk) often attack intruders in
their territory on sight. They live in simple familial communities, battling rival
groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They
occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty
leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like
nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with
a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath
is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the ﬁrst
intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty
empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this
era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some
of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins,
venerating their ancestors’ accomplishments, while others consider these areas
taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don’t
agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result
of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the
corruptive inﬂuence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.
Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this
day, paying homage and offering live sacriﬁces to terrible creatures from
the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser
demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into
occultism might summon a more powerful ﬁend that either tears the
xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.
Xulgath Warrior
Xulgath warriors strike with fury and eager cruelty, always ready for
the next ﬁght. The taking of prizes from battle—including weapons and
items stolen from defeated foes along with grislier trophies harvested
from fallen victims’ ﬂesh—is a popular pursuit among these vicious
reptiles, and those whose armor and scales are most adorned are
awarded the greatest respect (and perhaps fear) from their kin.
