# GIANT ANIMATED STATUE
================================================================================

Giant Animated Statue
As with any humanoid animated statues of Medium size, giant animated statues
are used to guard locations of importance, but their increased size and power
make them most useful in large vaults, spacious chambers, or outdoor locations.
Animated objects of this strength and size are ideal for tasks and responsibilities
usually performed by golems, and more powerful animated objects are thus all
but unheard of.

Brazier The statue carries a wide brazier full of hot coals. To make ﬂaming coal Strikes
or use Burn Alive, the statue must have the brazier held in one hand or otherwise
have it within reach. Instead of targeting the statue with an attack, a creature can
target the brazier directly. The brazier has the same AC and saves as the statue.
Dealing 15 cold damage to the brazier
or dousing it with at least 2 gallons of
water extinguishes the coals. This
prevents the statue from using
Burn Alive and causes its
ranged attacks to no longer
deal 2d8 ﬁre damage.
Burn Alive Ȱɵ
(ﬁre)
The
statue grinds a creature it

GUARDED TREASURES
Animated objects are mindless
constructs. While this leaves
them no concept of the value
of treasure, they are often
used as guardians for vaults or
repositories of valuables. In these
cases, the treasures they guard
can vary wildly, but should be of a
value appropriate for the animated
object’s level.

Ankhrav
Ankhravs are immense, burrowing, and insectile predators, considered by
inhabitants of the rural areas of the world to be an all-too-common plague.
Ankhrav
These horse-sized, burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like
cities, but ankhravs’ predilection for livestock and humanoid ﬂesh ensures that
the creatures do not remain in the deep wilderness for long. Desperate farmers
whose ﬁelds become infested by ankhravs often have little recourse but to seek
the aid of adventurers.

# GORILLA
================================================================================


Ape
While many apes exhibit peaceful or reclusive behavior, gorillas can be territorial,
and the megaprimatus is especially aggressive and dangerous.
Gorilla
Gorillas can be territorial creatures, particularly if provoked by hunters or the
presence of more dangerous monsters. A gorilla uses its fangs and powerful arms
to bite and pummel trespassers with wild abandon.

Megaprimatus
The megaprimatus is among the mightiest of apes,
quick to confront any perceived intrusions into its
domain. With a height of 40 feet, it towers over even
most giants, and is used to being the top-tier predator
in the region.

================================================================================
# GANCANAGH
================================================================================


WANDERING AZATAS
While the idyllic realm of Elysium
is the home plane of azatas, their
overwhelming curiosity and
natural wanderlust often lead
them to travel far from this plane.
On other planes, they can be
seeking to right wrongs, looking
for entertainment, or merely
exploring to see the sights. More
than a few azatas, taken by a
whimsical urge to spread their
sometimes unwelcome jocosity,
see it as their duty to tease uptight
or humorless mortal creatures.
Gancanagh (Passion Azata)
Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments of
free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but earnest
ﬂings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve Cayden
Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium
who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings
that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the
demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love.
One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a
creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed
paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy
drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can’t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many
gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes
them look dapper. They cherish their silver ﬂutes, for they enjoy the beauty of
ﬂutes’ music and its ability to sway the heart.
The majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of
gender to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely,
is much more ﬂuid and open to interpretation than for many mortals.
Gancanaghs enjoy using this ﬂexibility to confront and test mortals’
convictions when faced with fear or prejudice, but when encountering
mortals who themselves are open-minded about sexuality or gender identity,
they can become lifelong allies. For those who are persecuted for such reasons,
gancanaghs are tireless defenders and eager supporters, quick to provide safety
and to punish those who would attempt to impose narrower beliefs upon a
world that deserves more diversity than it often gets. If possible, a gancanagh
seeks to educate and redeem those who hold destructive beliefs or prejudices,
resorting to combat only to defend themself or an endangered mortal, or when
no other option seems tenable—yet even then, they ﬁght with sadness.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The gancanagh
can take on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t
change their Speed or their attack and damage bonuses with their Strikes, but
might change the damage type their Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Invigorating Passion ʚʖ (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) The gancanagh
embraces or kisses a willing creature, infusing that creature with their
invigorating passion. The creature gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls
and 10 temporary Hit Points for 10 minutes. After that time, the target
becomes fatigued for 10 minutes unless they succeed at a DC 21
Fortitude save.

AZATA TREASURES
While azatas would like to think
they are above material wealth,
the truth is that most azatas adore
ﬁnery and displays of beauty or
grandeur. They might explain away
bejeweled weapons as necessary
tools against the forces of evil,
or the wild array of jewelry and
silks they wear as important
diplomatic tools.
Lillend (Muse Azata)
Lillends are tale-tellers, chroniclers, and champions of freedom of expression.
They are generally peaceful, but are quick to act if a masterful piece of art
is threatened or free speech is suppressed. They pride themselves on inspiring
mortals to greater heights of expression and creativity, and more than one bard
looks to a lillend as their personal inspiration. Lillends sometimes secretly
follow the adventures of mortal heroes to record their stories as epic poems
and songs, which they then perform in the packed mead halls of Elysium. When
pursuing such goals, lillends take pains to use their innate spells to remain in
hiding, as they would rather observe and record events without “polluting” them
with their own intervention. Nevertheless, a lillend who sees their charge faced
with certain death often cannot resist the urge to intervene and save the day.
Inevitably, this brings a close to the lillend’s chronicles, as their relationship with
their subject invariably shifts from one of detached observation to friendship
or more. Yet lillends remain hesitant to involve themselves for
overlong in a mortal’s life, in part because they fear what sort of
ﬁendish attention their presence might attract, but mostly out
of respect for the mortal’s own destiny. A lillend would, all
things being equal, prefer to let mortals choose their own
fate rather than run the risk of sending someone down
a path to which their heart is not set.

================================================================================
# GHAELE
================================================================================


OTHER AZATAS
The wilds of Elysium play host
to a wide array of azatas, the
most varied and widespread of
the celestials. From the foureyed mothlike uinuja to the
supernaturally verdant and
beautiful veranallia, whose lower
body is a wondrous garden of
wildﬂowers and plant life, azatas
are nothing if not diverse!
Ghaele (Crusader Azata)
Ghaeles are ﬁend-hunting knights of Elysium and champions of the freedom to take
up arms against oppressors and other evils. Ghaeles rarely engage directly in mortal
wars, but where ﬁends are involved they make an exception. A ghaele might assume
the guise of a mortal to ﬁght ﬁends alongside others, hoping to bolster morale and
teach good tactics against such supernatural foes. Ghaeles serve various deities and
empyreal lords of Elysium, though many have an afﬁnity for Cayden Cailean in
his capacity as a champion of freedom and defender of the downtrodden. Among
azatas, ghaeles are generally the quickest to shift to violence as a method of solving
problems, but even then they seek to minimize pain and suffering when they can.

Free Blade Ȳ˓ Trigger The ghaele ends its turn while unable to act or
attempts a greatsword Strike that would take a circumstance or
status penalty. Eﬀect A ghaele’s blade is implacable in the pursuit
of freedom, and its energies can overpower any eﬀect that would
interfere with its swordplay. The ghaele attempts to counteract
each eﬀect that prevents it from making a greatsword Strike, gives
it a penalty to its greatsword Strike, or prevents it from acting. The
ghaele can use this ability even if it’s otherwise unable to act.
Light Form A ghaele’s body is partially corporeal and partially composed
of light, with a color corresponding to the elemental energy currently
residing in its blade (see Choose Weakness). It can move through solid
objects but can’t end its action within a solid object.

Divine Rituals DC 33; resurrect
Choose Weakness Ȱɵ (concentrate, divination, divine, evocation, manipulate) A
ghaele attempts to Recall Knowledge about a foe it is facing. If successful, it
can change the elemental damage dealt by its greatsword and light ray to acid,
cold, electricity, ﬁre, or sonic, usually to match the a foe’s weakness. It can also
change its energy resistance to any of these energy types (this can be a diﬀerent
type than for its attacks). The choices remain until it next uses Choose Weakness.
Ghaele’s Gaze Ȱɵ (divine, evocation, visual) When a ghaele ﬁxes its gaze upon a non-good
creature, the creature suﬀers the eﬀects of divine decree (DC 33 Will save). If it survives,
the creature is temporarily immune to Ghaele’s Gaze for 1 minute.
Holy Blade (divine, evocation) Any weapon becomes a +2 holy striking weapon
while the ghaele wields it.

BORN FROM TRAGEDY
The banshee represents one of the
most tragic of undead, a soul so
wracked with agony and fury over
a betrayal in life that, in death, it
lingers on as a great evil. That most
of those who become banshees
were not evil in life only deepens
this tragic theme, and many elven
adventurers see it as their duty
not only to put banshees to rest,
but to right the wrong that
saw their creation in the
ﬁrst place.
Banshee
Banshees are the furious, tormented souls of elves bound to the Material Plane
by a betrayal that deﬁned the ﬁnal hours of their lives. Some banshees arise from
elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed
them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous deeds
shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin,
banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horriﬁc inversion
of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf
(and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.
Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt
thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many
banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, speciﬁcally in Tanglebriar,
the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees
can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as
plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture.
Banshees’ mere touch inﬂicts pain and primal fear, and those
exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.

# GREATER BARGHEST
================================================================================


not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of
gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few
grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the
end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make
such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new
abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.
In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests,
the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations
that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon
their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options
detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for
barghest mutations—feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with
new mutations of your own design.

As barghest.
Mutations The process of consuming corpses to
evolve into a greater barghest results in odd and
unpredictable physiological changes. A greater
barghest has one mutation, typically chosen from
the following options.
• Fangs (poison) The barghest grows elongated fangs
that seep poison. Its jaws deal 1d6 additional poison
damage and 1d6 persistent poison damage.
• Toxic Breath ʚʖ (divine, evocation, poison) The
barghest breathes a cloud of toxic gas that deals 8d6
poison damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC 25
basic Fortitude save). It can’t use Toxic Breath again for
1d4 rounds.
• Vestigial Arm Strike Ȳ˓ Frequency once
per round; Trigger The barghest completes
a Strike. Eﬀect The barghest makes a claw
Strike with a shriveled third arm hanging
from its torso. This attack doesn’t count for the
barghest’s multiple attack penalty, nor does
that penalty apply on
the attack.
• Wings The barghest
has malformed wings
extending
from
its
back. It gains a ﬂy Speed
of 25 feet.
BARGHEST CULTS
The barghest hero-gods may
be the only ones of their kind
capable of granting spells to
their clerics, but the idea of
adoring worshippers appeals to
all barghests. A barghest that
completes its transformation into
a greater barghest, and thus is no
longer morbidly distracted by its
hunger, often plays the role of a
deity to ignorant groups of goblins
or other monsters. To them, the
fact that the barghest can’t grant
spells is irrelevant—rather, their
veneration is due the fact that
worshipping the barghest is the
best way to keep it from devouring
the entire tribe.

Basilisk
The basilisk is an eight-legged reptile with a nasty disposition and the ability
to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like for the
cockatrice, the ﬁrst basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and
incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk’s physiology lends any credence
to this claim.
A basilisk prefers to eat petriﬁed ﬂesh. Once a victim has been turned to
stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets
its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow
and inefﬁcient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as
if in mid-petriﬁcation itself. This has even led to the saying “as slow as a wellfed basilisk.” Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful
nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has
much need for speed.
An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300
pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to
a guttural gurgle when they’re agitated. Though they are normally solitary
creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports
of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these
unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown.
For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk’s stare,
and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order
to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a
basilisk’s blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this
is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of
previously petriﬁed creatures or body parts.

# GIANT BAT
================================================================================

Blood Feast Ȱɵ Each enemy in the bat swarm’s space takes 1d4 piercing damage (DC 16
basic Reﬂex save). Creatures that fail this save also take 1 persistent bleed damage.
Giant Bat
While big bats are certainly not uncommon in dark caves and abandoned ruins
and may instill fear in squeamish spelunkers, the so-called giant bat is a true
monster, weighing well over 100 pounds and having a wingspan of nearly 15
feet. It primarily eats fruit and bugs, but can be incited to violence through fear
or hunger. Giant bat attacks can quickly give rise to rumors
of more dangerous monsters—many mistake these massive
animals for some sort of demon or vampiric monster. But like
other bats, giant bats are simply social and intelligent mammals.
They are sometimes used as mounts by smaller humanoids,
commonly those who hail from or dwell in mountainous or
underground regions.

BAT LOCATIONS
Vampire bat swarms roost in
colonies wherever they can
ﬁnd shelter from weather, light,
and predators, favoring caves,
trees, and narrow gorges. Giant
bats prefer to dwell in smaller
numbers in deep caves, abandoned
mines, or the attics of abandoned
buildings. Even larger species
dwell in the deeper regions of
the Darklands, where they are
often used as mounts, or even
ritualistically slaughtered and then
animated as specialized undead
guardians of eerie underground
cities and nations.

Bears are ferocious predators typically found in cold or temperate woodlands
and hills. Many species of bear exist in addition to the two presented below,
such as the smaller (but no less dangerous) black bear or the arctic-dwelling
polar bear.
Grizzly Bear
This large and powerful omnivore inhabits forested hills. While it typically
sustains itself on nuts, berries, ﬁsh, and small mammals, it’s ﬁercely territorial
and will chase off or kill any creature it views as competition. Grizzly bears are
especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly bear
often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues its
assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear is hungry,
it will not hesitate to feed.

Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins, the cave
bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in

natural caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is ﬁercely territorial.
Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will
make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its
prey’s soft ﬂesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often
regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remote-dwelling people,
while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants—stone
giants in particular have an afﬁnity for keeping trained cave bears as
pets or guardians for their homes.

# GIANT STAG BEETLE

Light Flash Ȱɵ (concentrate, light) The ﬂash beetle creates a brilliant ﬂash of

Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 minute. The ﬂash beetle’s glow
then goes out, disabling its aura for 24 hours, during which
time it cannot use Light Flash.
Giant Stag Beetle
The giant stag beetle is larger than a horse, and the sight of
one ﬂying (if slowly and somewhat clumsily) on great buzzing
wings is unnerving. Its enormous mandibles are used to impress
mates, intimidate rivals, and discourage predators, for they can
deliver deadly blows. While giant stag beetles are deadly predators,
they can be domesticated by skilled wranglers. In such a capacity, these
beetles serve well as beasts of burden or even as mounts.
Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes,
and heavy forests. More than one logging camp has attracted a cluster
of giant stag beetles and had to be completely abandoned, yielding
all its lumber to the hunger of the giant insects.

BLOODSEEKER TREASURE
Bloodseekers have no interest in
treasure, but their lairs tend to
be scattered with the remains of
adventurers—and their valuables.
Bloodseeker
Scourges of swamps and damp, abandoned places, bloodseekers are ravenous
blood drinkers. Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It
is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker’s regional name “stirge,”
possibly a corruption of the word “scourge,” comes. Folk wisdom holds that the
appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but
more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven’t been properly tended to.
Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution
by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren’t
hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps
even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal “tools” to drain
away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers
of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith
and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those
who accidentally give too much are considered to have been “blessed” by the
village’s hungry god.
Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently
malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat
rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be
scared away by waving torches at the ﬂying pests. However, bloodseekers are
much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim
lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and
disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker ﬁnds a likely victim while its clot is
nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.
Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate
bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve
as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker
prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared
from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of speciﬁc creatures are a
staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual
bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.
A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin
and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with
blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily
in the air as it ﬂies off to digest its meal.

Attach When a bloodseeker hits a target larger than itself, its barbed legs attach
it to that creature. This is similar to grabbing the creature, but the bloodseeker
moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The bloodseeker is ﬂatfooted while attached. If the bloodseeker is killed or pushed away while attached
to a creature it has drained blood from, that creature takes 1 persistent bleed
damage. Escaping the attach or removing the bloodseeker in other ways doesn’t
cause bleed damage.
Blood Drain Ȱɵ Requirements The bloodseeker is attached to a creature. Eﬀect The
bloodseeker uses its proboscis to drain blood from the creature it’s attached to.
This deals 1d4 damage, and the bloodseeker gains temporary Hit Points equal to the
damage dealt. A creature that has its blood drained by a bloodseeker is drained 1 until
it receives healing (of any kind or amount).
BLOODSEEKER LOCATIONS
Bloodseekers hunt close to
their nests, which they make
in fens, bogs, fetid pools, and
abandoned buildings. A foot-wide
amalgamation of mud and reeds is
a telltale sign of a bloodseeker nest.

BOAR RESOURCES
A boar’s carcass typically provides
enough meat for 100 meals or
more, as well as hide and bristles
that can be used for crafting.
Boar
While domesticated pigs are a staple of farm life, wild boars are much more
dangerous. Foul-tempered warthogs are relatively common, while the lumbering,
primeval beasts known as daeodons are less so. Voracious eaters, boars can
ravage the countryside in which they live. Boars breed freely, and a pair of boars
can rapidly grow to a large family. Boars are a particular nuisance to farmers, as
they break into food stores and root through gardens to sate their hunger.
Boar
Boars are omnivorous mammals, hunted heavily because their meat is considered
a delicacy. Boars are most likely to attack humanoids either in self-defense or
during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra
inch of tissue to protect their organs as they ﬁght off rivals. Of course, in some
cultures boars are trained to become much more aggressive so they can ﬁll the
roles of warbeast and guardian. When such boars escape back into the wild, they
can become true terrors of the region.

# GREAT CYCLOPS

Swipe ʚʖ (ﬂourish) The cyclops makes a melee Strike and compares the attack roll
result to the AC of up to two foes, each of whom must be within its melee reach and
adjacent to each other. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature hit. A
Swipe counts as two attacks for the cyclops’s multiple attack penalty.
Great Cyclops
Gigantic, dim-witted loners, the great cyclopes embody their lesser kin writ
large. They are both stronger and more violent, but their uncontrolled vision
into possible futures has driven them beyond reason. They see every moment
as a potential storm of uncontrollable fury, and out of a desperate desire for
peace, quiet, and an end to their hunger, they lash out at all who come near. Wise
creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost.
Debate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They
are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by
their lesser kin, but they are now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other
scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species.
Whatever foolish decision or wayward curse caused the end of their civilization
is still playing out, occasionally causing a cyclops to withdraw from its own kind,
lose all semblance of intellect, and mutate into a lumbering, feral colossus. It
is fortunate indeed that the great cyclops prefers to dwell far from humanoid
settlements, because its immeasurable bloodlust inspires it to destroy virtually
anything that moves, from dinosaurs and other monsters to the occasional
explorer or soon-to-be-lost caravan.

Daemon
Denizens of the bleak and terrible plane of Abaddon, daemons are shaped by and
devoted to the destruction of life in all its forms. They seek the death of every mortal
being by the most painful and horrible means possible, all in service to the apocalyptic
entities known as the Four Horsemen. Each kind of daemon represents a different
way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular
form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down
into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use
the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons
always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often,
daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other ﬁends, knowing that such
confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all ﬁends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own
numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a
supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least
of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in
other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy,
a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the
greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Cacodaemon (Harvester Daemon)
These embodiments of demented violence and spite are spawned from eddies of
angry and warped souls amid Abaddon’s mists. Cacodaemons constantly hunger
for mortal souls and yearn to create suffering. As gnashing spheres of teeth, ﬁns, and
spines, they are the weakest of daemonkind, an amalgam of various petty forms of
death without the strength that comes from focusing on a single cause of demise.

DEMONIC POSSESSION
Some demons specialize in the art
of possessing creatures or objects
to spread fear and chaos. In such
cases a demon gains a powerful
disguise with which to work its
evils upon the world, a subterfuge
that delights the demon.
in that case, the eﬀect occurs after the last vrock uses Dance of Ruin or one of the
vrocks chooses to complete that round of the dance. Each non-demon creature in a
20-foot emanation from any of the dancing vrocks takes 2d12 electricity damage
(DC 28 basic Reﬂex save). For each additional vrock that joins the dance, the damage
increases by 1d12 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four vrocks dealing
5d12 damage with a DC 31 save). The vrocks can continue dancing by using Dance of
Ruin each round, for up to 3 rounds in total. The emanation’s size increases by 20 feet
each round, and the damage increases by 1d12 per vrock each round.
Spore Cloud Ȱɵ (disease, poison) The vrock emits a cloud of spores from their body,
dealing 2d8 poison damage to all adjacent creatures. Each creature damaged this way
must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 2d8 persistent piercing damage as the
spores penetrate its skin and grow into thick, green vines. The vines cease growing
after 10 rounds, and they wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved oﬀ before then. The
vines can be destroyed if the creature is aﬀected by a good spell or if holy water is
applied to the vines (with an Interact action). Once the vrock uses Spore Cloud, the
ability can’t be used for 1d6 rounds.
Stunning Screech Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, incapacitation, sonic) Frequency once per minute.
Eﬀect The vrock emits a shrill screech. Each non-demon creature within a 30-foot
burst must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is stunned 2,
and on a critical failure, it’s stunned 3.
Glabrezu (Treachery Demon)
Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting
mortal desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as
easily as they breathe. Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to
fruition in the most destructive way possible, turning a wish or hope
into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although the long-term
repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a
struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only
to ﬁnd that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the
weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted
in the form of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus
are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal’s needs.
These massive demons have enormous pincers and
a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their
chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess
formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the
souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.

continue inﬂicting such torments on those it encounters.
Shemhazians delight in visiting torment upon mortals, of course, but
more than most demons, these ﬁends revel in sharing the pain with their
own kind. Other demons fear and hate shemhazians for this reason, with
only the most powerful willing to work with a shemhazian to achieve a
shared goal. Even then, the shemhazian is always on the watch for an opportunity
to bring pain and suffering to its allies along with any foe.

FIRE AND ICE
The classic depiction of Hell
is of a burning wasteland of
magma and volcanoes, a searing
landscape rife with the screaming
souls of the damned. Yet those
who have visited Hell know the
awful truth—for its torments do
not cease at eternal burning.
Some regions of hell are perpetual
frozen reaches of razor-sharp ice
and ﬂesh-scouring wind, while
others are miasmic swamps ﬁlled
with poison and disease. Hell does
not limit its torturous toolbox
merely to the ﬁres for which it is
so well known!
Gelugon (Ice Devil)
Insectile ice devils are strategists and masterminds in Hell’s armies, using their
superior intellect to strike against their enemies and spread Hell’s inﬂuence
throughout the planes. An ice devil rarely breaks their solitary contemplation of
strategy save to pursue a plan they have devised. They can be enticed otherwise
only by an exchange of services to be determined at a later time, adding to
the pieces they can play on the board. Occasionally, a mortal strategist of
outstanding skill might amuse an ice devil enough for the gelugon to agree to
a contest of strategy, typically a strategic board game like chess, to decide a
dispute. In the unlikely event the devil loses such a contest, they inevitably go to
great lengths to later obtain that mortal’s services for their own infernal ends.

Slowing Frost (cold, divine, evocation) The ice devil channels the extreme cold of its
body through its appendages and weapons. A creature hit by an ice devil’s weapon
or unarmed attack in melee must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for
1d4 rounds. A weapon used by an ice devil gains the eﬀects of a frost rune while the
gelugon holds it, and the ice devil can throw any such weapon with a 20-foot range
increment, trailing motes of frost.
Tactician of Cocytus Ȱɵ (concentrate) An ice devil’s logical mind devises genius tactics
from its perfect memory. It can telepathically send a tactical repositioning to its
allies, allowing all commanded or allied evil creatures in the range of its telepathy
to immediately Stride (or Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim, if the creature has the
corresponding Speed).
Pit Fiend (Tyrant Devil)
When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellﬁre, it
is likely that one of Hell’s most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit ﬁend,
masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit ﬁends often
serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds,
and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity. To
realize their tyrannical machinations, pit ﬁends claim mortal souls that they corrupt
into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal
manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell’s formidable legions. They
often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies, drawing upon
these lesser devils’ depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous
and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the pit ﬁend’s enemies.
Pit ﬁends themselves are crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus,
the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes.
Those pit ﬁends that don’t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper
layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell’s elite, gathering cabals and sects that
shape Hell’s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many
pit ﬁends see themselves as living embodiments of hellﬁre, the all-encompassing
wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by ﬁre. In Avernus,
Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit ﬁends build vast citadels of brimstone
wreathed in ﬂame to lord over.
Pit ﬁends tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over
1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet.
INFERNAL DUKES
Elite members of Hell’s political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the
dukes of Hell are chosen from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and
conniving devils. While not all infernal dukes are pit ﬁends, a pit ﬁend’s natural
disposition toward conquest and oppression often make it an ideal candidate
for this position. To create an infernal duke, adjust the pit ﬁend to be between
21st and 25th level. Because of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and
powerful spellcasting abilities, infernal dukes make excellent villains for longrunning campaigns.

Elananx
These strange, fey felines resemble large, broad bobcats from a distance, but a closer
view reveals something amiss. Their forms ripple and billow with heat, and their
eyes glow from within as if they contain tiny, ﬂickering ﬂames. The pungent scent
of rotting leaves smoldering in a bonﬁre clings to their fur. Yet those who have the
chance to watch elananxes hunt or attack prey witness the greatest indication that
these creatures are something more than mere predators, for they act with cruel and
savvy instincts, reveling in the pain they inﬂict.
Elananxes typically hunt alone, but sometimes these cunning and malicious
hunters of the First World roam in packs called “billows” to take down large prey.
Like many house cats, elananxes are not content to merely track and devour prey,
but prefer to toy with their victims, drawing joy and excitement from the fear and
pain of those they capture. To this end, elananxes rarely use their cinder dispersal
ability to evade their targets, instead opting to foil their quarry just before the end
of the hunt—though, as selﬁsh creatures who wish to live to hunt again, elananxes
often reserve one use of this ability, just in case.
Because of their clever and malicious ways, elananxes are favored as hunting
companions by redcaps (page 278), who go out of their way to befriend or make
deals with these creatures. Redcaps also ﬁnd great sport in hunts where competing
elananxes chase a single creature. Although they’re large enough to serve as mounts
for redcaps, elananxes despise being ridden and resist such attempts—little is as sure
to cause a supposedly friendly elananx to turn on its redcap ally than a foolhardy
attempt to treat the fey cat as a horse!
Elananxes have a strange afﬁnity to forest ﬁres. Because they are immune to
the damage caused by ﬂickering ﬂames, they enjoy capering and caterwauling
through the smoky, burning ruins of forest infernos. Some have even been known
to use their burning bites to deliberately light undergrowth on ﬁre, simply so they
might experience the beauty of the ﬂames combined with the inevitable pain such
disasters inﬂict on other creatures.

FAILED FLESHWARPS
Not every ﬂeshwarp emerges
from its vat capable of survival.
Many perish within minutes, as
organs fundamental for life simply
fail or collapse in on themselves.
Fleshwarpers can usually recycle
failed ﬂeshwarps back into the mix
quickly enough, but now and then,
remnants known as ﬂeshdregs are
stable enough to live pain-wracked
lives of their own. These foul
creatures often infest ﬂeshwarper
holdings, like rats or other vermin
do in less awful locations.
Fleshwarp
Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies.
They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying
transformative technique known as ﬂeshwarping. Though the ﬂeshwarping
process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow
torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their ﬂesh
and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of ﬂesh
results in countless variations of ﬂeshwarps, and the following are just a couple
of examples of these horrors.
Grothlut
Sluglike abominations, grothluts are ﬂeshwarps that were once humans. While
their head and torsos are vaguely human, their arms are rubbery and move

consciousness pleads to be free from their horrid warped form.
Many ﬂeshwarpers consider the grothlut to be a failure of a creation, as the
transformation all but stamps out the human consciousness. Others disagree,
arguing that warping the creature’s mind makes it all the more useful, since
its stupidity makes it pliable and easy to herd. Drow typically use grothluts
as guardians that slowly patrol the edges of their enclaves. Once in position,
grothluts can be used as crude shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces
before more-valuable warriors wade in and cut down the enemies who have been
nauseated by the grothluts’ exploded organs and ﬂesh.

or deactivate the aura by using a single

senses the presence of a non-grothlut creature,
and it usually stops once it doesn’t sense

OTHER FLESHWARPS
Grothluts may be the weakest
example of a ﬂeshwarp, and
driders the most successful, but
others exist as well. Ghonhatines
are lumbering ﬂeshwarps formed
from xulgaths, while the tentacled
irnakurses are formed from surfacedwelling elves. Sinspawn (pages
296–297) are ﬂeshwarps as well, of
course, although their methods of
creation diﬀer drastically from the
techniques mastered by drow.
Drider
The ﬁrst ﬂeshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their most
successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that
of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic ﬂeshwarp—the only ﬂeshwarp
known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos
of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders
have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form
with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reﬂection on the
matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.
Although the ﬂeshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment
for drow who fell from grace, the signiﬁcant powers and strengths gained from the
horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of
lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure.
In return for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian,
soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead
their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city’s periphery. The painful truth is
that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow
have a penchant for working their ﬂeshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in
deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.
Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well
known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider’s innate spells
remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different
types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared
than the drider presented below.

Focused Assault ʚʖ The ﬂytrap attacks a single target with both its leaves. The

leaf Strike plus an additional 1d8 damage for every leaf beyond
the ﬁrst. On a failure, the ﬂytrap deals the damage from
one leaf Strike, but it can’t use Improved Grab. It deals no
damage on a critical failure. This counts toward the ﬂytrap’s
multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of
leaves the ﬂytrap has.
Hungry Flurry ʚʖ The ﬂytrap makes two leaf Strikes at a –2

GARGOYLE TREASURE
The obsessive nature of gargoyles
can result in a variety of treasure
hoards and grim trophy collections,
ranging from stockpiles of arcane
tomes to alchemical potions and
apparatuses to simple trinkets.
Gargoyle
Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their
resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the day and
descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that of a
horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great deal
of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling
no known creature. A gargoyle’s features are not ﬁxed; city-dwelling gargoyles
who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match
the style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for
long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.
Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome
tribes called “wings” for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become
relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other
creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances
exist on a razor’s edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive,
and petty—traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive
and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim
trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual
subjects or certain artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the
dissolution of wings as individuals’ obsessions and compulsions clash.
Kapoacinth
Kapoacinths dwell not amid cliffs or rooftops, but beneath
the sea, using their wings to swim. These water-dwelling
gargoyles often dwell in shallow coastal regions
and shamble forth from the sea to attack prey.
Kapoacinths are less individualistic and tend to
create more stable wings for longer periods
of time. Kapoacinths have the same
abilities as the gargoyle presented below,
but with the following adjustments:
they have the aquatic trait, they have
a swim Speed of 40 feet instead of
a ﬂy Speed, and their Clawed Feat
reaction triggers when they are
Swimming instead of Flying.

Genie
A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies
are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn
are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are ﬁre made ﬂesh; marids are
beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the
jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind.
Genie Nobles
Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie
society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example
of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels,
genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and
notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant
wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power)
can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within
a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles
to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However,
once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are
freed from service to that creature forever.
Janni
Jann are genies composed of all four elements, meaning they are not
quite home on any of the Elemental Planes. Instead, jann reside on the
Material Plane, making only brief forays to the other parts
of the Inner Sphere. Although they are human in size and
appearance, jann are not at all related to humans and
bristle at any claims to this effect. They are a proud people
and take great care to maintain their honor—restoring that
honor with the edge of a sword, if necessary.

THE FIRST GHOULS
Legend holds that the ﬁrst
humanoid (an elf, as it so
happened) to feed upon the ﬂesh
of his brother rose as a ghoul
after death, in time embracing his
new life and ascending to great
power as a demon lord of ghouls,
graves, and secrets kept by the
dead. That ghouls of humanoids
warp and twist to take vaguely
elven features, and that elves
themselves are immune to ghoul
paralysis, are unusual side eﬀects
of this ancient source, yet today,
ghouls are as likely to worship
other vile gods—or simply eschew
faith entirely—as they are to honor
the ﬁrst of their kind.
Ghoul
Few creatures are more ubiquitous to sinister locations such as lonely graveyards
and ruined crypts than the ﬂesh-eating undead known as ghouls.
Creating Ghouls
You can turn a living creature into a ghoul by completing the following steps. When
creating a ghast, double these numerical adjustments. The monsters in this section
are built from the ground up, so their numbers don’t match these guidelines exactly.
Custom-building ghouls is recommended if you have time, using the special abilities
listed here but creating the other statistics to match what you want the ghoul to be.
First, increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
• Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 1.
• Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the
creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath
weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
GHOUL ABILITIES
A ghoul gains the undead and ghoul traits, and it usually becomes evil. If the base
creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It
also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and
humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conﬂict with the theme of a
ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC
of the ghoul’s level (Core Rulebook 503).
Darkvision
Negative Healing
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Claws If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile
unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If
it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should
be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it
had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal threequarters that damage.
Jaws If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws
Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage
plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount
should be the same as the creature’s non-agile attacks.
Consume Flesh Ȱɵ (manipulate) Requirements The
ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died
within the last hour. Eﬀect The ghoul devours a chunk of
the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has. It
can regain Hit Points from any given corpse only once.
Ghoul Fever (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill
eﬀect (1 day); Stage 2 2d6 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from
all healing (1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4 2d6 negative damage and gains
no beneﬁt from healing (1 day); Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage 6 dead, and rises as a
ghoul the next midnight.
Paralysis (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living, non-elf creature hit by a ghoul’s
attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. It can attempt a new save
at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.
Swift Leap Ȱɵ (move) The ghoul jumps up to half its Speed. This movement doesn’t
trigger reactions.
GHaST ABILITIES
A ghast has all the abilities above, plus following additions.
Stench (aura, olfactory) 10 feet A creature entering the aura or
starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save
(use a DC based on the monster’s level; Core Rulebook 503)

OVERSIZED THEMES
Giants are larger-than-life foes.
While many giants have themes
that tie them to elemental or
magical forces, the primary theme
giants share is that they embody a
classic cultural trope as their basis.
Fire giants, for example, can be
seen as oversized smiths, while
hill giants should evoke the
ﬂavor of an oversized bully.
Giant
Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout
the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.
Hill Giant
Selﬁsh and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately cowards.
Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages the
defenseless but is quick to ﬂee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better
organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of their
own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.

GIBBERING MOUTHER
TREASURE
While gibbering mouthers have
little interest in treasure, they are
known to consume their prey’s
valuables along with the creatures’
ﬂesh. Those treasures which are
not themselves digestible remain
until the gibbering mouther
disgorges them or is destroyed.
Gibbering Mouther
Amorphous blobs of yammering mouths and oozing, ﬂeshy sludge, gibbering
mouthers are among the strangest creatures found either aboveground or below.
Perpetually ravenous, these aberrations are always seeking their next meals,
ever eating but never sated. With a nominal intelligence, gibbering mouthers
can understand and even speak Aklo, but they do so in an intelligible manner
only rarely. Instead, their innumerable mouths constantly jabber and babble in a
stream of sound that disrupts the thought patterns of other creatures in the area.
Where, how, and why gibbering mouthers originated are questions without answers.
They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to
theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested
that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal’s attempt to create something akin to
a shoggoth—though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe
gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some
forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little
to say on the matter—at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless
hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers’ noises—studies that put
researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best.
Whatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion.
Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well
as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv. They are
somewhat less common in the upper region of Nar-Voth, perhaps due to the

GIMMERLING TREASURE
Gimmerlings collect weapons,
traps, mechanical novelties,
and dangerous magic items.
A gimmerling is likely found
with tools (like artisan’s tools,
repair kits, and thieves’ tools)
and items it can use to appear
more vulnerable, such as locks,
manacles, and snare kits (which it
feigns being trapped by).
Gimmerling
Gimmerlings are small, shapeshifting fey who stage ambushes to sate their
endless hunger and childish greed. These cruelly curious fey obsess over ﬁnding
and making unusual traps and sadistic weapons, and their favorite amusement is
seeing these traps sprung or the weapons wielded. When on the Material Plane,
they are frequently found in urban areas, particularly slums or other parts of
town where they can either go unnoticed or be easily forgotten—and have plenty
of victims to choose from.
A typical gimmerling disguises itself as an endangered child, doing so in hopes
of drawing creatures close enough to rob. The gimmerling puts itself in apparent
danger using a trap, construct, or bribed ally, or even a coerced monster like
a redcap (page 278).
Because gimmerlings sometimes trade obscure smithing or trapping techniques
in exchange for gifts that sate their curiosity, their greed, or their hunger, they
have at times been worshipped as minor gods of the forge. Some disciplined
gimmerlings work as honored artisans, elite guards, or spies for the demigods
known as the Eldest who dwell in the depths of the First World.

Gnoll
Gnolls are short, hyena-headed humanoids who dwell in warm grasslands,
savannas, and arid hills. Given their appearance, their afﬁnity for hyenas
should not be surprising; gnolls share their homes, food, and even many of their
own behaviors with these animals. Much like hyenas, gnolls have a notorious
reputation—they are known as bloodthirsty gluttons and slavers who worship
demons or other reprehensible powers. Though these rumors are often true, the
behavior of gnoll clans varies widely. Some groups are composed of capable
hunters who rarely clash with other humanoids unless there is a conﬂict over
territory. Others hew closer to the unsavory stories, preferring to raid settlements
and enslave innocents, snatching the fruits of others’ hard labor by strength of
arms and forcing their victims to perform the hard, demeaning labor necessary to
maintain the brutal clan.
Gnolls lack any particular reverence for the remains of the dead, which adds
to their reputation as scavengers or even cannibals. They willingly eat nearly any
other creature, including dead gnolls, which can evoke strong reactions from
people and cultures with a strong taboo against cannibalism or desecrating the
dead. To a gnoll, it is almost more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its
origin; gnolls see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging
world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the ﬂesh of a dead gnoll, which they
consider an insult to that gnoll’s memory and sacriﬁce and an implication
that the gnoll’s ﬂesh is unworthy of consumption. In fact, they refuse
to eat the bodies of particularly hated foes; particularly warmongering
gnolls even spike the bodies or heads of such despised enemies on tall
spears, which they place around their tribal holdings to dishonor the
dead and intimidate would-be invaders.
Gnoll women are far stronger and more aggressive than gnoll men
and are typically considered the leaders of their hunting packs and
clans. Though gnolls tend to be disorganized when it comes to
practical matters or negotiations, they are extremely efﬁcient at
working together to hunt down prey or overwhelm a group
of foes. Much like hyenas, they prefer to hunt in packs, and
are exceptionally skilled at setting up ambushes or separating
individual targets from larger groups.
Gnoll Hunter
Gnoll hunters serve their clans by hunting for food in
the wilds, marauding along well-traveled roads, and
tracking down escaped slaves.

setting up holdings out in the
open. Many gnolls establish their
encampments—typically made up of

Gnoll Cultist
Gnoll cultists serve as their clans’ spiritual guides and conduits to the divine. As

GOBLIN TREASURE
Although goblin warrens are
generally ﬁlthy dumps, they
sometimes contain actual
treasures stolen from longshanks
or other goblin tribes. Typical
treasures include small pieces of
jewelry, shiny items such as hand
mirrors, and gold teeth. As they
rarely trust each other, many
goblins keep their most cherished
baubles on their persons; these,
might include useful weapons or
minor magic items.
Goblin
These small humanoids have green or gray skin and large heads with wide ears.
While some goblins are civilized and have worked hard to be considered upstanding
members of humanoid communities, most are impetuous and vicious creatures who
delight in wreaking havoc. These goblins think nothing of slaughtering livestock,
stealing infants, or burning down a building purely for momentary delight. They
revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call “longshanks.”
Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with
ﬁre; goblins who master magic or ﬁre earn great respect from their kin. Most other
humanoids ﬁnd it difﬁcult to understand goblins’ outlook: they hate canines but
eagerly share their lairs with so-called “goblin dogs,” they fearlessly attack larger
creatures but are terriﬁed of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles
a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices.
Goblin Warrior
The frontline ﬁghters of goblin tribes prefer to ﬁght in large groups—especially
when they can outnumber their foes at least three to one.

Goblins race and goblins jump.

Goblins here and you be dead!
Chase the baby, catch the pup.
Bonk the head to shut it up.
Bones be cracked, ﬂesh be stewed,
We be goblins! You be food!
Goblin Pyro
Some goblins take their people’s admiration of ﬁre fully into the realm of deadly
obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of goblin raiders
eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however, their presence
is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros sometimes lose
sight of their tribe’s goals and simply set ﬁre to anything that will burn—including
their own allies.

GOBLIN DOG STORIES
Goblins adore their goblin dog
pets, and crafting stories about
goblin dog antics is a timehonored pursuit among many
goblin clans. Goblins often seek to
outdo prior stories by increasing
the audacity, ridiculousness,
and surreality of their tales.
Examples of popular goblin dog
tales include goblin dogs holding
fancy dinners in high society
among unwitting humans, goblin
dogs tainting dwarven ale in
unmentionable ways, and goblins
who transform into barghests
as a result of a goblin dog bite.
This last plot, in particular, has
some truth to it, as many credible
accounts point to the existence
of goblin dog werecreatures in
certain goblin tribes.
Goblin Dog
Goblins’ eponymous pets aren’t true canines at all, but rather large, blunt-nosed
rodents with thin bodies and long legs. As cowardly as they are ugly, goblin dogs
prefer to lurk behind bushes or in deep shadows, pouncing upon lone or wounded
prey. Goblin dogs frequently lair and roam in packs, but they are likely to ﬂee
from a ﬁght if injured, even if it means abandoning their pack-mates.
Goblin dogs take their name from their long association with goblins, who
breed the beasts as guard animals and mounts. Most goblins take issue with
the name, as the average goblin is appalled at the suggestion that these, their
favored mounts, have anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being
goblins, they haven’t bothered to come up with their own, unique name for
goblin dogs.
Even the most pampered goblin dogs have itchy mange and proliﬁc dander
that tenaciously affects those who come in contact with them. This “goblin
pox” causes itchy hives and festering sores that are as unsightly as they are
irritating and distracting. Goblin dog dander causes allergic reactions in nearly
all other creatures that don’t share the goblin dogs’ terrible hygiene—with the
notable exception, of course, of goblins, who remain entirely immune to the
disease regardless of cleanliness.
Hunger can drive goblin dogs to bouts of uncharacteristic violence; many
goblins purposefully starve their pets to make them more aggressive in battle.
Goblin dogs subsist on whatever organic material they can scavenge, and they
particularly enjoy fresh carrion. Although goblins are far from picky eaters,
they value goblin dogs as pets because the noisome animals will consume
food that even goblins won’t dare to eat. “Will it eat?” is one of several games
goblins enjoy playing with their goblin dog pets, where a wide range of mouthsized morsels (not always edible or safe to consume) are dangled before a
goblin dog’s snout. “Will it die?” is often a game played after “Will it eat?”
Goblin dogs who survive the second game earn renown for their digestive
prowess and often become favored tribal pets treated better than most of the
rank-and-ﬁle goblins.

GREAT GOGITETHS
As deadly as gogiteths are, rumors
persist of even more terrifying
threats known as great gogiteths.
Said to be nearly a hundred feet
across and capable of spawning
their own hordes of gogiteths in
reaction to being attacked, great
gogiteths are also reputed to be
unusually intelligent. The rumors
claim that great gogiteths are
largely content to lurk in their
deep, remote caverns and spend
the ages dreaming of sadism
and violence.
Gogiteth
A gogiteth is a slavering nightmare of teeth, eyes, and hairy spiderlike legs, and
its appearance is invariably seared into the minds of any who witness it. Hives of
these skittering monsters haunt the lowest reaches of the Darklands, competing
with cave worms and other subterranean horrors for food and resources. A
gogiteth is rarely seen alone, as these oversized vermin learned long ago that
the best means of survival is sticking close to others of their own kind. Even the
haughty drow know to seek cover when a gogiteth is spotted, for where there is
one, a swarm is sure to follow.
Gogiteths make a clacking sound as they move about. The joints in their many
legs pop and crack with each movement, though they can suppress this sound
voluntarily so that they can hunt without giving away their presence. The odd
creatures can also make a high-pitched whistling sound that echoes throughout
the caverns where they live. Some Darklands natives report that groups of
gogiteths sometimes join together in eerie, discordant songs.
Gogiteths’ alien anatomies have inspired no shortage of speculative origin
stories. Some believe they are the result of a ﬂeshwarping experiment gone
horribly wrong. Others think they may be related in some way to the Dominion
of the Black—possibly the distant cousins or some strange exile of that alien
entity; according to this mythos, once they made their way to this planet, the
gogiteths crawled into the depths of the earth, shying away from the blazing
sun above.
Gogiteths are a menace to every other denizen of the Darklands. Drow
and duergars in gogiteth-infested regions of Sekamina or Orv frequently
organize hunting parties to eradicate the terrors, even
calling for temporary truces with unlikely allies in times
when a gogiteth presence must be addressed. Since even
an average gogiteth hive can host up to two dozen of the
horrors, missions to eradicate them when they become
established are dangerous quests indeed.

FLESH GOLEMS
Few buyers want anything to do
with the remains of a destroyed
ﬂesh golem. An adventurer’s best
bet for proﬁting oﬀ of a ﬂesh
golem body is to disassemble it
piece by piece, extract the few
contraptions of steel and copper
meant to harness electricity, and
sell the parts to tinkerers who ask
few questions.
Golem
Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the
legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator’s commands—
often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator’s death. There
exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves
harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host
statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity
of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other,
less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue
to artiﬁcially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a
true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation.
Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem’s
unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from
these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difﬁcult to damage with weapons.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany
player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming,
expensive, and difﬁcult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even
hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called
“golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of
a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical
components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components
that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
Golem Antimagic
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other
than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few
types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are
listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block,
with the full rules appearing here. If an entry
lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”),
either type of spell can affect the golem.
• Harmed By Any magic of this type that
targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage
has no type) instead of the usual eﬀect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of
magic of this type or is aﬀected by a persistent eﬀect of the appropriate type, it
takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
• Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem
lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell
would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of
magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
• Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes
it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual eﬀect. If the
golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1
for that round.
•
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more
speciﬁc spells, with the eﬀects described in its stat block.
Flesh Golem
Made of odd scraps of skin and muscle, a ﬂesh golem
is a grotesque parody of life. Though it has no mind,
it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving
it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard
the laboratories and charnel houses of ﬂeshwarpers
and necromancers who feel no compunctions about
desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the
ﬁrst ﬂesh golem is believed to have been a misguided

================================================================================
PAGE 186
================================================================================

ALCHEMICAL GOLEMS
When an alchemical golem is
defeated or disabled, if any of its
ﬁrst four alchemical chambers
(1–4) remain intact, the chamber
can be salvaged and used as a
lesser alchemical bomb of the
corresponding type: acid ﬂask,
frost vial, bottled lightning, or
alchemist's ﬁre, respectively.
attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from
human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a ﬂesh golem if
the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful
personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.

# GRIFFON
================================================================================


Bestiary
Griffon
Griffons are regal beasts revered as symbols of freedom and strength in many
cultures. They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion and the
head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle, but some
instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even osprey or vulture. In rare
cases, the griffon’s hindquarters may resemble those of a different great cat,
such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the environment
in which the griffon lives—for instance, the especially rare griffons of northern
Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy
owl—though this is not always the case. Some griffons lack wings altogether.
These wingless griffons, known as alces, result from a rare mutation. Among a
clutch of other griffons, the alce is typically considered the runt, so few of these
offshoots survive their ﬂedgling stage. Those alces that do make it to adulthood
tend to be tougher, more violent, and more aloof than most griffons.
Wild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen
eyesight to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground
and grab up their victims is shocking. They may tear open victim’s ﬂesh with
their razor-sharp beaks, but usually just take their prey to a high, secluded
location where they can enjoy their feast without interruptions. On the ground,
they take cover and leap out to ambush prey, then ﬂy off with their prize. The
exception to this is when a griffon is hunting to feed its offspring, in which case
it will almost never purposefully bring a living creature back to its nest for fear
of endangering its chicks.
Skilled animal trainers long ago learned how to raise griffons as mounts
for military forces or powerful individuals. Such mounts are known for their
strength, bravery, and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals
and possess a wisdom not normally afforded most animals; it is
thought that a griffon chooses its rider as much as a rider chooses
the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept and carry
a rider in ﬂight is a long and expensive ordeal. Griffon trainers
charge rich sums for their services, and a ruler who can
boast of owning a stable of griffons is the subject of great
respect and envy.

THE FIRST GRIFFONS
The combination of two symbolic
and recognizable predators of
the land and air (the lion and
the eagle) is the result of devout
prayer among ancient cultures to
an equally ancient deity—a now
long-dead god named Curchanus,
who once held domain over the
beasts of the world. These ﬁrst
griﬀons were believed to be much
more intelligent and guardians
of the faith, but when Curchanus
was slain by Lamashtu,
the surviving griﬀons
regressed to little
more than beasts.

GRIKKITOG ORIGINS
Grikkitogs are the subject of
countless scary stories told among
denizens of the Plane of Earth,
many of which speculate upon
their origin. Some who remember
the wars between the elemental
lords believe the ﬁrst grikkitog
was an experiment created to
serve as a weapon for Ayrzul,
the evil Fossilized King of the
Elemental Plane of Earth, but its
hunger and power was so great
that it escaped containment,
infested an earth elemental
warden, and began to spread
throughout the plane.
Grikkitog
Grikkitogs, also known as “hungry earth,” are strange parasites from the Plane
of Earth that infest and possess earth, rock, and stone in order to feed their
endless hunger. A young grikkitog is a formless apparition until it corrupts an
earth elemental host, forming the grikkitog’s core. A grikkitog can then infest
the earth and stone nearby with its voracious essence, forming maws and eyes
all around it. These creatures are particularly dangerous to small creatures that
lair within gaps and holes among rocks, as well as mountain climbers searching
for the perfect handhold.

save. While immobilized, the victim takes
3d8 persistent bleed damage and the

DEAD MAN’S HAND
Decks of cards are a traditional
method used to tell a person’s
fortune, but legends hold that
certain cards or combinations of
unfortunate draws can attract
the attention of the grim reaper.
Specialized fortune-telling decks,
such as the Harrow, might
not feature the visage of the
grim reaper directly, but to the
paranoid, death could lurk in any
unfortunate hand of cards.
Grim Reaper
The Grim Reaper is the unﬂinching personiﬁcation of death. Silent as the grave and
as inevitable as time itself, this legendary being hunts down and ﬁnishes creatures
that have evaded death for far too long. Sometimes the Grim Reaper comes
without warning, while at others it comes to ﬁnish the work that other creatures
could not. The Grim Reaper serves no god, ﬁend, or aeon. It is both despised
and feared by psychopomps and celestials, but few—if any—dare to stand in its
way. Like some eternal plague, it kills those who try to cure the multiverse of its
presence. It stands alone and holds only its own council, and the pleading and
reasoning of mortals and immortals alike fall on deaf ears once the Grim Reaper
closes on its quarry. Its own reasoning is silent to mortal ears and inscrutable to
the mortal mind, but no matter the reason, the result is unyielding and ﬁnal.
While some legends hold that the Grim Reaper appears before everyone as
they die, the truth is quite a bit more disturbing. Such vigils in fact lie within the
providence of the psychopomps, a race of immortals charged with the protection
and guidance of mortal souls through the afterlife. The Grim Reaper has little
interest in protecting souls or guiding them. It is instead compelled by sinister
agendas arising within the nighted realm of Abaddon, where the Horsemen of the
Apocalypse rule. Indeed there are many similarities in shape and form between
the Grim Reaper and Charon, the Horseman of Death, but no recorded instance
exists of these two powerful entities working together. Instead, the Grim Reaper
serves as something of a manifestation of Abaddon itself, and in this regard is
believed by some to be an incarnation of the mysterious First Horseman. When
the Grim Reaper comes to a world, it does so not as an angel of mercy, but as a
relentless harvester of life. Those who fall to the Grim Reaper were not destined
to die as much as they were selected, hunted, and murdered.
Perhaps the most frightening legends surrounding the Grim Reaper concern
its nature as a singular entity, for some believe that more than one grim reaper
exists in the Great Beyond. These whispers tell of a cabal of at least nine of
these creatures that stalk reality, culling the living as inexplicable servants of
true entropy. According to the teaching of some death cults, the ﬁnal goal of the
Grim Reaper is to end the entire cycle of life and death and serve as a silent lord
of an empty universe.

Death Strike (death) A creature critically hit by any of the grim reaper’s attacks or that
critically fails against any of its spells must succeed at a DC 47 Fortitude save or die.
Energy Drain When the grim reaper hits and deals damage with its scythe, it regains 20 Hit
Points, and the target must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or become doomed 1. If the
target is already doomed, the doomed value increases by 1 (to a maximum of doomed 3).
Final Death A creature killed by the grim reaper can’t be brought back to life by any
means short of divine intervention.
Infuse Weapon (divine, evocation) Any scythe gains the agile trait, can’t be disarmed,
and becomes a +3 major striking keen scythe while the grim reaper wields it. If the
grim reaper Strikes a creature with a weakness to any speciﬁc type of damage, the
scythe’s damage counts as that type of damage, in addition to slashing.
Lesser Death
No one is quite sure what lesser deaths are, though some
claim that they are avatars of the grim reaper. Unlike that
strange hunter, however, lesser deaths hunt in packs on
rare occasions. More often than not, they manifest from
cursed magic items. Other times, they are just the enactors
of death, hunting in the same way the grim reaper does—
silently, with neither remorse nor quarter. Rarely, multiple
lesser deaths work together to cull a large population, their
scythes cutting through crowds and leaving entire cities
devoid of life, inspiring (hopefully) false rumors of

GUTHALLATH SLUMBER
Entire civilizations have been
swept oﬀ the face of Golarion due
to the devastating rampage of a
guthallath. But there is a light at
the end of the tunnel, for after
some time the guthallath ends its
massacre in a swift yet seemingly
random way. The colossus then
ﬁnds a remote location deep in the
wilderness, where it buries itself,
entering a deep slumber for years—
if not centuries—before awakening
and beginning the destructive cycle
once more.
Guthallath
A guthallath is an enormous construct created long ago by some unknown empire,
probably as a war machine. Nearly 100 feet tall, this massive stone statue typically
resembles a stalwart warrior wearing only a loincloth and skullcap. Few have seen
the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time such a relic is buried up to its
neck, covered in moss and stranded in some forgotten place. Yet, every so often, one
of these harbingers of destruction reactivates in response to some unknown stimulus
or rallying call, and when this happens, woe be unto any who stand in its way.
While the guthallath’s ancient enemies are gone, it is an engine of pure destruction,
designed to rampage for weeks or even months. While not intelligent enough to enjoy
or regret its acts, the guthallath cannot be reasoned with—it is unaffected by most
magic, and is unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and creatures it spares).

HATERS OF HUMANITY
Hags loathe all humanoid races,
but not equally—the brunt of their
wrath is leveled against humans.
Hags prey on human society the
most, adding human ﬂesh to their
cauldron and snatching newborn
children before replacing the
babes with their own progeny as
changelings (page 62).
Hag
Malevolent crones who lurk at the edges of civilization, hags use their deceptive,
magical abilities to prey upon humanoids, manipulating and corrupting them.
Some say hags arose from fey that became twisted by their inner selﬁshness.
Hags gather together in covens for greater power, craft unique magical items
known as hag eyes, and are known to replace infant humanoids with their own
offspring—these children are changelings (page 62) who have the potential to
become hags themselves.
Sea Hag
Sea hags kill and eat ﬁshers and sailors who come near their lairs, torment coastal
dwellers with dark promises and vague threats, and enjoy the act of causing
distress and discord in small towns. They generally avoid making their lairs too
close to civilization, however, to avoid drawing enemies to their homes. Sea hags
are known for tempting desperate victims into tragic and inescapable bargains,
deals which the hag has already secretly stacked in her favor. Despite their
voracious appetites, sea hags appear hideously emaciated,
and unlike more powerful hags, they lack the ability
to magically disguise their form.
Sea hags can join covens, but their aquatic nature
often prevents them from joining mixed covens
with other kinds of hags.

================================================================================
# GREEN HAG
================================================================================


HAG COVENS
Hags are dangerous enough on
their own, but when they gather in
threes to form covens, they grow
much more powerful. Full rules for
covens appear on page 342.
Green Hag
Green hags hate beauty and purity, so they use disguises and treachery to lure and
murder innocents, corrupt the pure of heart, and shatter the minds and morals of
their victims. Green hags create imaginative schemes to utterly ruin anyone who
crosses them, as well as good or righteous folk whose very existence insults the
hag’s twisted sensibilities. The complicated scandals perpetuated by green hags
involve impersonation, mistaken identity, the seduction and betrayal of loved
ones, or all these things in combination.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation)
The green hag can take on the appearance of any Medium
humanoid woman. This doesn’t change her Speed or
her attack and damage bonuses with her Strikes, but
might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically
to bludgeoning).
Enfeebling Humors (necromancy, occult) A creature damaged
by a hag’s claw must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or
be enfeebled 1 for 1 day. On a critical failure, or if it gets hit
again and fails its save a second time, it’s enfeebled 2 for 1 day.
Exhale Miasma ʚʖ (necromancy, occult) The green hag exhales
a miasma of green vapors. Each living creature in a 15-foot
cone is aﬀected by her enfeebling humors (attempting a save as
normal). She can’t use Exhale Miasma again for 1d4 rounds.
Annis Hag
Annis hags are brutal torturers and murderers, delighting in the musical
screams and tasty ﬂesh of young creatures and those who are pure of
heart. Annis hags are the most direct of all hags, engaging in physical combat
and using their change shape ability to hunt rather than to inﬁltrate and betray
humanoids. But an Annis hag takes a grisly trophy from each kill and uses
it to sow discord, sending the trophy to one of her victim’s loved
ones in a way that implicates another family member in the murder.
Also known as iron hags, annis hags have iron-like yet ﬂexible ﬂesh
that resists edged weapons, and their own touch is the same cold iron
that burns the ﬂesh of other hags. This allows them to bully their way to
the leadership of hag covens.

THE NATURE OF HAGS
Some believe that hags possess
no true form or body of their
own, but instead manifest from
society’s fear of aging. That no
known male hags exist has also
puzzled scholars, but perhaps
this is but another way in which
hags mock society—by presenting
themselves as awful stereotypes
of elderly women.

LIZARDS AND LIZARDFOLK
Giant lizards are often used as
mounts or guardians or kept
as pets, but never so often or
as traditionally as they are by
lizardfolk. The kinship these
people share with giant lizards
is unmistakable, valuing their
companionship to an extent that
equals or even exceeds that which
other societies have for popular
animal companions like dogs
and horses.
Lizard
Lizards have a wide range of appearances and abilities, but most share a basic
reptilian shape—long tails, wide toothy mouths, and four legs. While a few species
are capable of movement on two legs for short periods of time, most are strictly
quadrupedal. The three species presented here represent the most common and
well-known of the larger species.
Giant Gecko
These roughly human-sized reptiles have amazing feet capable of clinging
tenaciously to any surface. Giant geckos are typically docile and shy but can be
aggressive when cornered or defending their territory. These large-eyed lizards
are found in a wide variety of habitats, from rainforests and deserts to mountain
slopes or even underground caverns. They spend most of their time climbing
around in large trees or on rocky cliffs, whether hunting for small animals or
hiding from predators. A giant gecko’s scales are often quite brightly colored or
decorated in intricate patterns. Giant geckos span nearly 8 feet in length from
head to tail, and they weigh about 120 pounds.
Giant geckos are sometimes used by smaller humanoids as guardians
or mounts, as their docile nature makes them relatively easy to tame and
train. Their superior climbing skills make giant geckos particularly popular
within societies that dwell underground or near cliffs, such as goblins
and kobolds. Their bright coloration also makes them favorite exotic
pets in high society.

HP 20

Melee Ȱɵ jaws +8, Damage 1d8+2 piercing
Giant Monitor Lizard
Large and seemingly ponderous, a monitor lizard
is a deceptively swift and ruthless predator. It
ambushes its prey by rushing out from cover and
biting the target with its powerful jaws. A giant
monitor lizard’s saliva is venomous, allowing it to
bring down prey larger than it can easily haul away
in its jaws. Giant monitor lizards grow up to 14 feet
long, including their long tails, and they weigh
about 350 pounds. Their bodies are normally
dark brown with patches of yellow or green.
When nesting, a giant monitor lizard digs
a deep burrow to hide in. The burrow serves
as both a safe haven and a location from which
the lizard can ambush larger prey such as deer,
boars, or even humanoids. A giant monitor
lizard can consume nearly its own body weight in
a single meal, and its loosely articulated jaws allow it
to swallow surprisingly large prey.

common of their kind encountered
in the wilds. Stories of much
larger lizards persist, including
the immense, 20-foot-long
monster known as a megalania,
a truly enormous version of the

swallowing creatures whole. Less
dangerous is the giant chameleon,
although its ability to blend into
its environs makes it a much more

the lumbering, mighty megalania.

LIZARDFOLK RELATIONS
Though most are neutral in
alignment, the typical iruxi’s pride
in their traditions, suspicion of
others, and need to protect their kin
can make them seem standoﬃsh or
even aggressive when encountered.
However, most are eager to learn
from visitors, trade stories
and equipment, and
forge alliances.
Lizardfolk
When human scholars speak of ancient civilizations, they usually turn their
focus to themselves, researching and lecturing on the ﬁrst human empires.
When they drift to others, they invariably look to cultures that had conﬂicts
or alliances with ancient humanity. That the culture of the people called
lizardfolk often gets ignored or forgotten even by well-meaning researchers is
thus no surprise, but to the lizardfolk themselves it is no matter. They know
their history and value its integrity and privacy—if younger ancestries like
humanity aren’t interested in learning from lizardfolk empires dating back
to before the ﬁrst human knocked two rocks together to make their ﬁrst
campﬁre, that’s ﬁne with them.
The word “lizardfolk” is an excellent example of humanity’s narrowsighted view of this culture. The name of their people is “iruxi,”
but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and
good-naturedly accepted the name “lizardfolk” as
a variant, and they generally resist urges
to call humans and other mammalians
similarly derivative names in return.
Iruxis dwell and thrive in all
tropical and temperate biomes, but
they are most at home in swamplands,
coastal regions, and riverlands, for they
are talented swimmers, and ﬁsh and
aquatic plants make up a large part of their
preferred diets.
Lizardfolk Defender
The lizardfolk defender serves as a protector of the young,
guardian of the settlement, and when no other options are available,
soldier in time of war. They eagerly rise to the defense of their kin but
do not revel in battle. An iruxi defender would rather turn back intruders
and allow them to ﬂee with the knowledge they were beaten, in hopes that
such word prevents further invasions, but they are not naive. The iruxi
understand the need for revenge, and when they allow a foe to escape,
they do not forget.

oﬀer sacriﬁces of livestock or

# GUARDIAN NAGA
================================================================================


OTHER NAGAS
Beyond the sinister dark naga
and the benevolent guardian
naga, many other types of nagas
exist, including the mesmerizing
spirit naga, the multiheaded royal
naga, and the introspective and
mysterious lunar naga.
DC 25 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 5 minutes; Stage 1 slowed 1 (1 round);
Stage 2 slowed 2 (1 round); Stage 3 unconscious with no Perception check to
wake up (1d4+1 minutes)
Guardian Naga
The opposite of dark nagas in many ways, guardian nagas are benevolent and
wise protectors of places of great natural or supernatural signiﬁcance: ancient
oak groves, forgotten holy temples, and vaults of sacred power are just a few
examples of locations that these nagas protect. Guardian nagas believe that the
beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to
such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with
similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors
and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.
Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood,
to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to
protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place,
passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent
nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become

FROM THE DREAMLANDS
The nilith’s association with the
remote and little-understood
Dreamlands, also known as the
Dimension of Dreams, is unusual.
They draw power from a latent
dreaming connection to that
realm, but they are native to the
Material Plane.
Nilith
The sleek, dark niliths resemble hairless, emaciated tree sloths. These creatures
are intensely dangerous and fearsome, with red glowing eyes, wicked claws, and
mouths full of needlelike teeth. Niliths feed off the emotions, fears, and ﬂesh of
the living, and folktales posit that those who have nightmares of these creatures
are fated to one day be eaten by them. Niliths draw intense joy from tormenting
sapient creatures, often focusing their predations on the pious and the just, from
whom they draw forth their most basic fears and worst thoughts and revel in their
victims’ subsequent terror. More often than not, these despicable manipulators
wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack the
patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a
nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts
and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its ﬂesh and moving onto the
next victim.
Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant
dimension beyond dreams—in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding
machines for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected. Scholars
and dimensional travelers have attempted to uncover the exact mechanisms of
this mysterious connection, but they have yet to decipher the truth. Indeed, many
who investigate the nature of the nilith’s bond are driven to madness before
getting anywhere close. The odd connection to otherworldly beings might help
explain the longevity of these creatures, as it is believed that niliths can live for
thousands of years.
Thankfully for others, niliths are solitary creatures that hate the company of
their own kind, likely because these harbingers of nightmares have no wish to
taste the horrors they bring to others.

FILTH FLINGERS
Ofalths prefer to remain in their
middens and sewers, for in such
environs they have a constantly
renewing source of not only food,
but refuse to ﬂing at foes. An
ofalth encountered outside of
such wretched environs cannot
ﬂing rubbish as a ranged attack
unless it rips ﬁlth from its own
body. Each time it does so, it
takes 2d6 damage.
Ofalth
Found in castle dung heaps, city dumps, and sewers, ofalths are thought to be cousins
of shamblers. But whereas shamblers are living heaps of soggy vegetation, ofalths are
living heaps of matter from an altogether more unpleasant source: these monsters
look like 9-foot-tall amalgamations of wet detritus, sewage, and rubbish with long
tentacular arms and stout legs. It can be difﬁcult to tell where an ofalth’s body ends
and the foul contents of the cesspit they wallow within begins. They move through
refuse heaps in search of organic material in their endless quest to sate their hunger.
Though ofalths have a limited intellect, they still exhibit a vile curiosity. They
are no strangers to dissecting their prey after it has succumbed to their wasting
disease—a terrible and aptly named afﬂiction that causes the victim’s blood to
seep from its pores. When an ofalth manages to secure a victim alive, it may even
torture its food by consuming it bit by bit while it shrieks for mercy.
Ofalths’ domains typically overlap with those of otyughs, who fear ofalths, though
otyughs have also been known to band together in order to take down an ofalth for
its rubbery ﬂesh, which the otyughs consider an intoxicating delicacy. On the other
hand, ofalths seem to particularly enjoy taking otyughs apart one piece at a time.
They have been known to keep a captured otyugh alive for days or even weeks,
forcing the otyugh to endure the cloying scent of its own body decaying before the
ofalth feeds.

# GIANT SCORPION

Scorpion
Chitinous scourges of deserts, forests, savannas, and badlands, scorpions are
deadly arachnids with powerful pincers and a painful sting. Scorpions can be
found in nearly every climate, where they hunt their prey with a mixture of
patient stealth and raw strength. Most scorpions live in underground burrows,
either as lone hunters or part of a larger colony. These arachnids are so feared and
dangerous that in many cultures, they are treated as deities or dualistic symbols
of both death and protection from said death.
Giant Scorpion
These massive, terrifying arachnids are typically 8 feet long from head to the
base of the tail. Giant scorpions are the favored pack animals and war beasts of
various desert-dwelling monsters, particularly gnolls. They are most commonly
encountered in the wild, however. There they lair in mountainside caves or
burrow beneath shallow layers of sand where they lie in wait for prey to wander
near. Sleek, pallid subterranean scorpions also exist, as do still larger species.

SHAMBLER TREASURE
Shamblers collect trinkets from
their previous victims and store
them in small hollows within their
bodies. They particularly prize
gems, but also like alchemical
or magical items that produce
electrical eﬀects such as bottled
lightning and shock runes.
Shambler
Shamblers are cunning carnivorous plants that resemble heaps of wet, rotting
vegetation. Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don’t have
much in the way of identiﬁable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that
lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful
blows. Sometimes called “shambling mounds,” these ambush predators have a
particular fondness for ﬂesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker
down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter
or soil, but won’t do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed
may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.
Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the
few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the
plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote
jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils
toward the sky to hope for—or perhaps to summon—intense lightning strikes.
Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical
strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of
raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor,
and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected
(and powerful) elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between
and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast
primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid
of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield
awesome powers over electricity.
Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed
not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known
as “spore mounds,” discharge clouds of toxic spores from their
bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like
plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock
formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and
inﬂict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.

the right conditions—such as
when food is scarce or the shark
mistakes its victim for a seal—will
a shark attack a swimmer or small

enough for survivors to perpetuate
the myth of shark as maneater.
Shark
Sharks of all shapes and sizes have stalked the oceans, largely unchanged,

rows of razor-sharp teeth capable of rending prey in an instant. Their uncanny
ability to smell blood in the water means sharks might show up at any scene

INNATE SPELLS
A soulbound doll’s additional
3rd-level innate spell depends on
its alignment, as listed below.
Lawful Good: zone of truth

Soulbound Doll
Soulbound dolls are eerie mannequins or playthings that have been imbued with a
small piece of a deceased mortal’s soul. These little constructs are created for a variety
of reasons—such as to serve as companions or servants—but their free will means
their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally
abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls,
and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll,
regardless of the construct’s alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond.
Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including
human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel
soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures
is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save
against the creator’s Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor’s
death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given
consent to such use before their death occurred.
Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some
sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment’s power makes the doll’s
ﬁst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the
doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy
and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their
crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such
as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities.
Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted
during or shortly after a person’s death, this doesn’t affect the deceased’s
resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal
to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of
more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment
of a living soul without repercussions.
The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem (Hardness 10) typically
embedded in the doll’s neck or chest. The soul fragment isn’t static, and
the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality
and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor’s or
moving farther aﬁeld on its own individual path. The soulbound doll’s
focus gem retains the doll’s memories even after the doll’s destruction.
The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed
into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of
soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.

SPRITE PRANKS
Sprite pranks tend to be
kind-hearted in nature; they might
use their abilities to embarrass
a braggart or to trick them into
a convoluted scheme to help
someone notice an admirer who
has been there for them all along.
Their plans are often half-baked;
sprites’ mercurial nature means
they can easily become distracted
by something new before following
through on a previous plan.
Sprite
Elusive, ﬂighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers ﬁrst imagine when
they hear the terms “fey” or “fairy.” While their dispositions vary from the
benevolent grig to the trickster pixie, all sprites share a connection to magic and
diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most
populous member, the common sprite.
Sprite
Common sprites are primeval guardians that latch onto a person, place, or object
and defend it for their own inscrutable reasons. Their dispositions vary from kind
to spiteful, but all sprites have a capricious streak. Being only about 9 inches tall,
they are wary of animals that might hunt them, particularly house cats, and prefer
ﬂight to a ﬁght. On the other hand, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms
of magic and heedlessly gather around ley line nexuses or other places of power.

Luminous Fire (evocation, light, primal) A sprite naturally sheds light like a

light using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While
this light is extinguished, the sprite’s Strikes don’t deal fire damage
and they can’t use their luminous spark Strike.

Grigs are kindly musicians of the fey,
often getting themselves into trouble due
to their penchant for confronting evil well
beyond their ability to vanquish. Even so, they
ﬁght bravely and with great cunning, using their
magic and ranged sonic attacks while ﬂying
and leaping using their wings and powerful
cricket-like lower torsos to stay out of reach.

VARIANT PIXIE ARROWS
Pixies can enchant their
arrows with a wide variety of
eﬀects, though nearly all such
enchantments are designed to
charm or bewilder, never maim.
Some arrows may emulate the
eﬀects of spells such as confusion,
fear, hideous laughter, and
even suggestion.

Fiddle Ȱɵ (auditory, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A grig can rub its legs
together to create a catchy ﬁddling tune that compels others within 30 feet to dance
about, with varying eﬀects depending on a DC 18 Will save. A listener is temporarily
immune for 10 minutes on a success, but otherwise, if the grig continues to Fiddle
each round, the creature receives no additional saves.
Success No eﬀect.
Failure Flat-footed and –10-foot status penalty to Speeds.
Critical Failure As failure, and also slowed 1.
Pixie
Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish,
pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie
dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as
to defend themselves. Other creatures often have trouble
understanding a pixie’s rapid, rambling way of speaking.

# GIANT WASP
================================================================================


Bestiary
SACRED STINGERS
Wasps are upheld as sacred
among the priesthood of the
elven deity Calistria, goddess
of vengeance. Some priests of
Calistria summon giant wasps or
wasp swarms as servitors, while a
few nurture giant wasps as pets,
temple guardians, or companions.
Followers of Calistria, both
clergy and laypeople alike, seek
to emulate the wasp’s penchant
for leaving stung victims alive to
suﬀer over a long period: a ﬁtting
model for revenge.
PARALYTIC POISON
The poison of the giant wasp
loses its potency soon after being
harvested, but alchemists have
learned of a way to preserve
some of its properties by adding
a number of harsh additives; this
method makes it even deadlier.
Wasp
While the common wasp poses little threat to a hardy adventurer aside from
an uncomfortable sting, a large and aggressive swarm of these territorial
insects—to say nothing of their oversized kin—can lay low an entire party
of heroes. The wasps represented here are of the common variety also known
as yellowjackets, but many other sorts of dangerous wasps exist, such as a
Garundi variant that swarms in such great numbers that it can decimate entire
villages, and the dreaded extraplanar hellwasps, which build their nests within
the corpses of their victims.
Giant Wasp
Giant wasps are much more dangerous but less common than their smaller kin,
and—to the relief of those who encounter them—they tend to be solitary.

(1d6 days); Stage 2 drained 1 (1d3 days);

Wasp Swarm
Wasp nests are made of chewed wood ﬁbers foraged from
the surrounding ﬂora, which the wasps make into a material
similar to paper. A single wasp nest can house thousands
of individuals that emerge as a massive swarm. Most
swarms attack only to protect their nest or if otherwise
agitated, though druids and other primal enchanters
can bend these venomous vermin to their will—to deadly effect.
