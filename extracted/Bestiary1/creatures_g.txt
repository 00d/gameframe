Giant Animated Statue
As with any humanoid animated statues of Medium size, giant animated statues
are used to guard locations of importance, but their increased size and power
make them most useful in large vaults, spacious chambers, or outdoor locations.
Animated objects of this strength and size are ideal for tasks and responsibilities
usually performed by golems, and more powerful animated objects are thus all
but unheard of.

Brazier The statue carries a wide brazier full of hot coals. To make ﬂaming coal Strikes
or use Burn Alive, the statue must have the brazier held in one hand or otherwise
have it within reach. Instead of targeting the statue with an attack, a creature can
target the brazier directly. The brazier has the same AC and saves as the statue.
Dealing 15 cold damage to the brazier
or dousing it with at least 2 gallons of
water extinguishes the coals. This
prevents the statue from using
Burn Alive and causes its
ranged attacks to no longer
deal 2d8 ﬁre damage.

The
statue grinds a creature it

GUARDED TREASURES
Animated objects are mindless
constructs. While this leaves
them no concept of the value
of treasure, they are often
used as guardians for vaults or
repositories of valuables. In these
cases, the treasures they guard
can vary wildly, but should be of a
value appropriate for the animated
object’s level.

Ankhrav
Ankhravs are immense, burrowing, and insectile predators, considered by
inhabitants of the rural areas of the world to be an all-too-common plague.
Ankhrav
These horse-sized, burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like
cities, but ankhravs’ predilection for livestock and humanoid ﬂesh ensures that
the creatures do not remain in the deep wilderness for long. Desperate farmers
whose ﬁelds become infested by ankhravs often have little recourse but to seek
the aid of adventurers.

pheromone that causes all other ankhravs within a 100-foot
emanation to become quickened 1 until the start of the hive
mother’s next turn, and they can use the extra action only
for Burrow, Stride, or Strike actions. The hive mother
can’t unleash the pheromone again for 1d4 rounds.

in a 60-foot cone, dealing 8d6 acid damage and 1d6

can’t spew acid again for 1d4 rounds.
ANKHRAV BURROWS
As if the appearance of a hungry
ankhrav in a stretch of farmland
isn’t bad enough, it almost always
indicates the proximity of an
ankhrav hive nearby. A disturbing
number of ankhravs can infest
a lair. However, adventurers
brave enough to crawl through
the tangled burrows are often
rewarded with large amounts of
treasure as ankhravs have a habit
of dragging their victims back
to the deepest corners of their
den to feast, usually discarding
the remains with most of the
gear intact.

AZATA TREASURES
While azatas would like to think
they are above material wealth,
the truth is that most azatas adore
ﬁnery and displays of beauty or
grandeur. They might explain away
bejeweled weapons as necessary
tools against the forces of evil,
or the wild array of jewelry and
silks they wear as important
diplomatic tools.
Lillend (Muse Azata)
Lillends are tale-tellers, chroniclers, and champions of freedom of expression.
They are generally peaceful, but are quick to act if a masterful piece of art
is threatened or free speech is suppressed. They pride themselves on inspiring
mortals to greater heights of expression and creativity, and more than one bard
looks to a lillend as their personal inspiration. Lillends sometimes secretly
follow the adventures of mortal heroes to record their stories as epic poems
and songs, which they then perform in the packed mead halls of Elysium. When
pursuing such goals, lillends take pains to use their innate spells to remain in
hiding, as they would rather observe and record events without “polluting” them
with their own intervention. Nevertheless, a lillend who sees their charge faced
with certain death often cannot resist the urge to intervene and save the day.
Inevitably, this brings a close to the lillend’s chronicles, as their relationship with
their subject invariably shifts from one of detached observation to friendship
or more. Yet lillends remain hesitant to involve themselves for
overlong in a mortal’s life, in part because they fear what sort of
ﬁendish attention their presence might attract, but mostly out
of respect for the mortal’s own destiny. A lillend would, all
things being equal, prefer to let mortals choose their own
fate rather than run the risk of sending someone down
a path to which their heart is not set.

BORN FROM TRAGEDY
The banshee represents one of the
most tragic of undead, a soul so
wracked with agony and fury over
a betrayal in life that, in death, it
lingers on as a great evil. That most
of those who become banshees
were not evil in life only deepens
this tragic theme, and many elven
adventurers see it as their duty
not only to put banshees to rest,
but to right the wrong that
saw their creation in the
ﬁrst place.
Banshee
Banshees are the furious, tormented souls of elves bound to the Material Plane
by a betrayal that deﬁned the ﬁnal hours of their lives. Some banshees arise from
elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed
them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous deeds
shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin,
banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horriﬁc inversion
of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf
(and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.
Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt
thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many
banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, speciﬁcally in Tanglebriar,
the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees
can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as
plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture.
Banshees’ mere touch inﬂicts pain and primal fear, and those
exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.

the eﬀects of terrifying touch based on the results of the same Will save.

Terrifying Touch (emotion, enchantment, fear, occult) A creature damaged
by the banshee’s touch that isn’t already frightened must attempt a DC
38 Will save (DC 43 if the attack was a critical hit). If the creature fails
its save, it’s frightened 2; on a critical failure, the creature also cowers
with fear and is stunned 4. If the creature is protected against fear by a
spell or magic item, the banshee’s touch ﬁrst attempts to counteract the
protection eﬀect, with the eﬀect of a 9th-level dispel magic spell.
Wail ʚʖ (auditory, concentrate, death, necromancy, occult) The banshee
unleashes a soul-chilling wail of the banshee (DC 38). This Wail overcomes
silence and similar eﬀects of 5th level or lower. The banshee can instead
use Wail as a three-action activity to overcome such eﬀects of up to
8th level.
The banshee’s Wail resonates for 1 round, and any creature that comes
within the area during that time must attempt a save against the eﬀect. A
creature can’t be aﬀected more than once by the same Wail. The banshee
can’t Wail again for 1d4 rounds.

Basilisk
The basilisk is an eight-legged reptile with a nasty disposition and the ability
to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like for the
cockatrice, the ﬁrst basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and
incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk’s physiology lends any credence
to this claim.
A basilisk prefers to eat petriﬁed ﬂesh. Once a victim has been turned to
stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets
its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow
and inefﬁcient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as
if in mid-petriﬁcation itself. This has even led to the saying “as slow as a well-
fed basilisk.” Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful
nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has
much need for speed.
An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300
pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to
a guttural gurgle when they’re agitated. Though they are normally solitary
creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports
of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these
unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown.
For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk’s stare,
and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order
to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a
basilisk’s blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this
is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of
previously petriﬁed creatures or body parts.

(arcane,

stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. That
creature must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save. If it
fails and has not already been slowed by Petrifying
Glance or this ability, it becomes slowed 1. If
the creature was already slowed by this ability
or Petrifying Glance, a failed save causes the
creature to be petriﬁed permanently.
A creature petriﬁed in this manner that
is coated (not just splashed) with fresh
basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk
that has been dead no longer than
1 hour) is instantly restored to
ﬂesh. A single basilisk contains
enough blood to coat 1d3 Medium
creatures in this manner.
BASILISK LAIRS
Basilisks can be found in almost
any terrestrial environment,
including forests, hills, mountains,
plains, and swamps. They tend
to dwell in caves or sheltered
areas, and their hides often bear
complexions that allow them
to more easily blend with their
environments. As a result, forest-
dwelling basilisks may have scales
of a verdant emerald color to
match surrounding vegetation,
while a basilisk that lives in the
desert may be a sandy brown or
shale color.

Bear
Bears are ferocious predators typically found in cold or temperate woodlands
and hills. Many species of bear exist in addition to the two presented below,
such as the smaller (but no less dangerous) black bear or the arctic-dwelling
polar bear.
Grizzly Bear
This large and powerful omnivore inhabits forested hills. While it typically
sustains itself on nuts, berries, ﬁsh, and small mammals, it’s ﬁercely territorial
and will chase off or kill any creature it views as competition. Grizzly bears are
especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly bear
often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues its
assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear is hungry,
it will not hesitate to feed.

Rush ʚʖ The grizzly bear Strides and makes a Strike at the end of that movement.

Cave Bear
Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins, the cave
bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in
remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in
natural caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is ﬁercely territorial.
Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will
make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its
prey’s soft ﬂesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often
regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remote-dwelling people,
while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants—stone
giants in particular have an afﬁnity for keeping trained cave bears as
pets or guardians for their homes.

BEAR RESOURCES
A bear den can contain valuable
treasures, such as the remains of
less fortunate adventurers who
stumbled into a hungry bear’s
path. Bear furs themselves are
valued as rugs, while their claws
and fangs make for impressive
jewelry or adornments for armor.
Bear hide is an excellent resource
for hide armor.

BLOODSEEKER TREASURE
Bloodseekers have no interest in
treasure, but their lairs tend to
be scattered with the remains of
adventurers—and their valuables.
Bloodseeker
Scourges of swamps and damp, abandoned places, bloodseekers are ravenous
blood drinkers. Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It
is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker’s regional name “stirge,”
possibly a corruption of the word “scourge,” comes. Folk wisdom holds that the
appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but
more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven’t been properly tended to.
Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution
by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren’t
hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps
even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal “tools” to drain
away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers
of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith
and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those
who accidentally give too much are considered to have been “blessed” by the
village’s hungry god.
Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently
malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat
rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be
scared away by waving torches at the ﬂying pests. However, bloodseekers are
much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim
lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and
disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker ﬁnds a likely victim while its clot is
nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.
Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate
bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve
as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker
prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared
from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of speciﬁc creatures are a
staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual
bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.
A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin
and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with
blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily
in the air as it ﬂies off to digest its meal.

Attach When a bloodseeker hits a target larger than itself, its barbed legs attach
it to that creature. This is similar to grabbing the creature, but the bloodseeker
moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The bloodseeker is ﬂat-
footed while attached. If the bloodseeker is killed or pushed away while attached
to a creature it has drained blood from, that creature takes 1 persistent bleed
damage. Escaping the attach or removing the bloodseeker in other ways doesn’t
cause bleed damage.
Blood Drain Ȱɵ Requirements The bloodseeker is attached to a creature. Eﬀect The
bloodseeker uses its proboscis to drain blood from the creature it’s attached to.
This deals 1d4 damage, and the bloodseeker gains temporary Hit Points equal to the
damage dealt. A creature that has its blood drained by a bloodseeker is drained 1 until
it receives healing (of any kind or amount).
BLOODSEEKER LOCATIONS
Bloodseekers hunt close to
their nests, which they make
in fens, bogs, fetid pools, and
abandoned buildings. A foot-wide
amalgamation of mud and reeds is
a telltale sign of a bloodseeker nest.

BOAR RESOURCES
A boar’s carcass typically provides
enough meat for 100 meals or
more, as well as hide and bristles
that can be used for crafting.
Boar
While domesticated pigs are a staple of farm life, wild boars are much more
dangerous. Foul-tempered warthogs are relatively common, while the lumbering,
primeval beasts known as daeodons are less so. Voracious eaters, boars can
ravage the countryside in which they live. Boars breed freely, and a pair of boars
can rapidly grow to a large family. Boars are a particular nuisance to farmers, as
they break into food stores and root through gardens to sate their hunger.
Boar
Boars are omnivorous mammals, hunted heavily because their meat is considered
a delicacy. Boars are most likely to attack humanoids either in self-defense or
during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra
inch of tissue to protect their organs as they ﬁght off rivals. Of course, in some
cultures boars are trained to become much more aggressive so they can ﬁll the
roles of warbeast and guardian. When such boars escape back into the wild, they
can become true terrors of the region.

Daeodon
Where the typical boar is merely ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the
towering daeodon is legitimately hateful and ruthlessly violent. Although
omnivorous, the daeodon (known in some regions simply as a giant boar)
prefers to feed on ﬂesh. Primarily a scavenger, the daeodon isn’t adverse
to attacking creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or
to protect any perceived encroachment into its lair or feeding grounds.
Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as
mounts or war-trained battle beasts; orc cavalry mounted on
daeodons is a fearsome force indeed.
A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet tall at
the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.

Daemon
Denizens of the bleak and terrible plane of Abaddon, daemons are shaped by and
devoted to the destruction of life in all its forms. They seek the death of every mortal
being by the most painful and horrible means possible, all in service to the apocalyptic
entities known as the Four Horsemen. Each kind of daemon represents a different
way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular
form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down
into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.
While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use
the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons
always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often,
daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other ﬁends, knowing that such
confusion compounds mortals’ fear.
While all ﬁends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own
numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a
supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least
of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in
other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy,
a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the
greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”
Cacodaemon (Harvester Daemon)
These embodiments of demented violence and spite are spawned from eddies of
angry and warped souls amid Abaddon’s mists. Cacodaemons constantly hunger
for mortal souls and yearn to create suffering. As gnashing spheres of teeth, ﬁns, and
spines, they are the weakest of daemonkind, an amalgam of various petty forms of
death without the strength that comes from focusing on a single cause of demise.

Numerous powerful and unique
daemon demigods, known
collectively as harbingers, rule
over swaths of Abaddon. Above
these demigods, though, are
entities of even greater power—the
four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
As the eons go on, the names and
identities of speciﬁc horsemen
change. Currently, they consist of
Apollyon (Horseman of Pestilence),
Charon (Horseman of Death),
Szuriel (Horseman of War),
and Trelmarixian (Horseman of
Famine). Of these, only Charon has
never fallen to an upstart. Some
hold that a “Fifth Horseman” once
ruled over the other four, while
others maintain that the eternally
eclipsed sun in the skies above
Abaddon is all that remains of this
long-dead god.

Captive Rake Ȱɵ Requirements A creature is grabbed in the glabrezu’s pincer. Eﬀect The
glabrezu pulls the grabbed creature up to 5 feet closer, then makes two claw Strikes
against it. Those Strikes count as one attack when determining a treachery demon’s
multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn’t increase until after both Strikes.
Steady Spellcasting When a reaction would disrupt a glabrezu’s spell, the demon can
attempt a DC 15 ﬂat check, avoiding the disruption on a success.
Sudden Betrayal A glabrezu can always use Deception when rolling initiative as
long as they’re aware of at least one opponent before initiative is rolled. When using
Deception for initiative, the demon gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception.
Treacherous Veil A glabrezu’s illusory disguise can allow it to appear as a creature of any size.
Twisted Desires (divination, divine) Once per month, a glabrezu can grant a mortal
humanoid the eﬀects of a miracle spell granted by an Abyssal patron, though the
glabrezu always perverts the miracle according to their own treacherous nature.
Shemhazian (Mutilation Demon)
Shemhazians rise from the souls of torturers and those who reveled in
mutilating the physical bodies of their victims. Standing 35 feet tall, a
shemhazian is well equipped with a wide range of talons, claws, and fangs to
continue inﬂicting such torments on those it encounters.
Shemhazians delight in visiting torment upon mortals, of course, but
more than most demons, these ﬁends revel in sharing the pain with their
own kind. Other demons fear and hate shemhazians for this reason, with
only the most powerful willing to work with a shemhazian to achieve a
shared goal. Even then, the shemhazian is always on the watch for an opportunity
to bring pain and suffering to its allies along with any foe.

Slowing Frost (cold, divine, evocation) The ice devil channels the extreme cold of its
body through its appendages and weapons. A creature hit by an ice devil’s weapon
or unarmed attack in melee must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for
1d4 rounds. A weapon used by an ice devil gains the eﬀects of a frost rune while the
gelugon holds it, and the ice devil can throw any such weapon with a 20-foot range
increment, trailing motes of frost.
Tactician of Cocytus Ȱɵ (concentrate) An ice devil’s logical mind devises genius tactics
from its perfect memory. It can telepathically send a tactical repositioning to its
allies, allowing all commanded or allied evil creatures in the range of its telepathy
to immediately Stride (or Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim, if the creature has the
corresponding Speed).
Pit Fiend (Tyrant Devil)
When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellﬁre, it
is likely that one of Hell’s most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit ﬁend,
masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit ﬁends often
serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds,
and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity. To
realize their tyrannical machinations, pit ﬁends claim mortal souls that they corrupt
into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal
manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell’s formidable legions. They
often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies, drawing upon
these lesser devils’ depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous
and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the pit ﬁend’s enemies.
Pit ﬁends themselves are crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus,
the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes.
Those pit ﬁends that don’t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper
layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell’s elite, gathering cabals and sects that
shape Hell’s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many
pit ﬁends see themselves as living embodiments of hellﬁre, the all-encompassing
wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by ﬁre. In Avernus,
Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit ﬁends build vast citadels of brimstone
wreathed in ﬂame to lord over.
Pit ﬁends tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over
1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet.
INFERNAL DUKES
Elite members of Hell’s political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the
dukes of Hell are chosen from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and
conniving devils. While not all infernal dukes are pit ﬁends, a pit ﬁend’s natural
disposition toward conquest and oppression often make it an ideal candidate
for this position. To create an infernal duke, adjust the pit ﬁend to be between
21st and 25th level. Because of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and
powerful spellcasting abilities, infernal dukes make excellent villains for long-
running campaigns.

Elananx
These strange, fey felines resemble large, broad bobcats from a distance, but a closer
view reveals something amiss. Their forms ripple and billow with heat, and their
eyes glow from within as if they contain tiny, ﬂickering ﬂames. The pungent scent
of rotting leaves smoldering in a bonﬁre clings to their fur. Yet those who have the
chance to watch elananxes hunt or attack prey witness the greatest indication that
these creatures are something more than mere predators, for they act with cruel and
savvy instincts, reveling in the pain they inﬂict.
Elananxes typically hunt alone, but sometimes these cunning and malicious
hunters of the First World roam in packs called “billows” to take down large prey.
Like many house cats, elananxes are not content to merely track and devour prey,
but prefer to toy with their victims, drawing joy and excitement from the fear and
pain of those they capture. To this end, elananxes rarely use their cinder dispersal
ability to evade their targets, instead opting to foil their quarry just before the end
of the hunt—though, as selﬁsh creatures who wish to live to hunt again, elananxes
often reserve one use of this ability, just in case.
Because of their clever and malicious ways, elananxes are favored as hunting
companions by redcaps (page 278), who go out of their way to befriend or make
deals with these creatures. Redcaps also ﬁnd great sport in hunts where competing
elananxes chase a single creature. Although they’re large enough to serve as mounts
for redcaps, elananxes despise being ridden and resist such attempts—little is as sure
to cause a supposedly friendly elananx to turn on its redcap ally than a foolhardy
attempt to treat the fey cat as a horse!
Elananxes have a strange afﬁnity to forest ﬁres. Because they are immune to
the damage caused by ﬂickering ﬂames, they enjoy capering and caterwauling
through the smoky, burning ruins of forest infernos. Some have even been known
to use their burning bites to deliberately light undergrowth on ﬁre, simply so they
might experience the beauty of the ﬂames combined with the inevitable pain such
disasters inﬂict on other creatures.

be attacked or targeted, and it doesn’t take up space.
Anything inside this cloud is concealed, and any creature
ending its turn there takes 2d6 ﬁre damage. At the start of
its turn, the elananx returns to its normal form in any square
the cloud covered. If the elananx Strikes a creature using its
ﬁrst action after returning to its normal form, the target is ﬂat-
footed and the Strike deals an extra 1d6 ﬁre damage.

ELANANX LOCATIONS
Although many elananxes dwell
in the strange realm of the First
World, some are also natives of the
Material Plane. Elananxes prefer
to dwell in regions where there
are ample intelligent creatures
to chase, hunt, and eat, and they
favor woodlands and hills as their
primary hunting grounds.

OTHER FLESHWARPS
Grothluts may be the weakest
example of a ﬂeshwarp, and
driders the most successful, but
others exist as well. Ghonhatines
are lumbering ﬂeshwarps formed
from xulgaths, while the tentacled
irnakurses are formed from surface-
dwelling elves. Sinspawn (pages
296–297) are ﬂeshwarps as well, of
course, although their methods of
creation diﬀer drastically from the
techniques mastered by drow.
Drider
The ﬁrst ﬂeshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their most
successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that
of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic ﬂeshwarp—the only ﬂeshwarp
known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos
of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders
have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form
with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reﬂection on the
matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.
Although the ﬂeshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment
for drow who fell from grace, the signiﬁcant powers and strengths gained from the
horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of
lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure.
In return for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian,
soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead
their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city’s periphery. The painful truth is
that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow
have a penchant for working their ﬂeshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in
deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.
Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well
known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider’s innate spells
remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different
types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared
than the drider presented below.

GARGOYLE TREASURE
The obsessive nature of gargoyles
can result in a variety of treasure
hoards and grim trophy collections,
ranging from stockpiles of arcane
tomes to alchemical potions and
apparatuses to simple trinkets.
Gargoyle
Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their
resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the day and
descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that of a
horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great deal
of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling
no known creature. A gargoyle’s features are not ﬁxed; city-dwelling gargoyles
who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match
the style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for
long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.
Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome
tribes called “wings” for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become
relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other
creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances
exist on a razor’s edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive,
and petty—traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive
and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim
trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual
subjects or certain artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the
dissolution of wings as individuals’ obsessions and compulsions clash.
Kapoacinth
Kapoacinths dwell not amid cliffs or rooftops, but beneath
the sea, using their wings to swim. These water-dwelling
gargoyles often dwell in shallow coastal regions
and shamble forth from the sea to attack prey.
Kapoacinths are less individualistic and tend to
create more stable wings for longer periods
of time. Kapoacinths have the same
abilities as the gargoyle presented below,
but with the following adjustments:
they have the aquatic trait, they have
a swim Speed of 40 feet instead of
a ﬂy Speed, and their Clawed Feat
reaction triggers when they are
Swimming instead of Flying.

Genie
A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies
are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn
are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are ﬁre made ﬂesh; marids are
beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the
jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind.
Genie Nobles
Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie
society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example
of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels,
genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and
notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant
wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power)
can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within
a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles
to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However,
once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are
freed from service to that creature forever.
Janni
Jann are genies composed of all four elements, meaning they are not
quite home on any of the Elemental Planes. Instead, jann reside on the
Material Plane, making only brief forays to the other parts
of the Inner Sphere. Although they are human in size and
appearance, jann are not at all related to humans and
bristle at any claims to this effect. They are a proud people
and take great care to maintain their honor—restoring that
honor with the edge of a sword, if necessary.

THE FIRST GHOULS
Legend holds that the ﬁrst
humanoid (an elf, as it so
happened) to feed upon the ﬂesh
of his brother rose as a ghoul
after death, in time embracing his
new life and ascending to great
power as a demon lord of ghouls,
graves, and secrets kept by the
dead. That ghouls of humanoids
warp and twist to take vaguely
elven features, and that elves
themselves are immune to ghoul
paralysis, are unusual side eﬀects
of this ancient source, yet today,
ghouls are as likely to worship
other vile gods—or simply eschew
faith entirely—as they are to honor
the ﬁrst of their kind.
Ghoul
Few creatures are more ubiquitous to sinister locations such as lonely graveyards
and ruined crypts than the ﬂesh-eating undead known as ghouls.
Creating Ghouls
You can turn a living creature into a ghoul by completing the following steps. When
creating a ghast, double these numerical adjustments. The monsters in this section
are built from the ground up, so their numbers don’t match these guidelines exactly.
Custom-building ghouls is recommended if you have time, using the special abilities
listed here but creating the other statistics to match what you want the ghoul to be.
First, increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 1.
•	 Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the
creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath
weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
GHOUL ABILITIES
A ghoul gains the undead and ghoul traits, and it usually becomes evil. If the base
creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It
also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and
humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conﬂict with the theme of a
ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC
of the ghoul’s level (Core Rulebook 503).
Darkvision
Negative Healing
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Claws If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile
unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If
it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should
be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it
had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-
quarters that damage.
Jaws If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws
Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage
plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount
should be the same as the creature’s non-agile attacks.
Consume Flesh Ȱɵ (manipulate) Requirements The
ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died
within the last hour. Eﬀect The ghoul devours a chunk of
the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has. It
can regain Hit Points from any given corpse only once.
Ghoul Fever (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill
eﬀect (1 day); Stage 2 2d6 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from
all healing (1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4 2d6 negative damage and gains
no beneﬁt from healing (1 day); Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage 6 dead, and rises as a
ghoul the next midnight.
Paralysis (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living, non-elf creature hit by a ghoul’s
attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. It can attempt a new save
at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.
Swift Leap Ȱɵ (move) The ghoul jumps up to half its Speed. This movement doesn’t
trigger reactions.
GHaST ABILITIES
A ghast has all the abilities above, plus following additions.
Stench (aura, olfactory) 10 feet A creature entering the aura or
starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save
(use a DC based on the monster’s level; Core Rulebook 503)

GHOULISH SOCIETY
Ghouls are quite intelligent and,
more so than almost any other
undead, prone to forming societies

ones centered around ﬂesh eating
and acts of depravity) in tangled
warrens below boneyards, or even
entire cities hidden away in the
depths of the Darklands.
or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 as long as itʼs sickened on a critical failure). While
within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease
and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Claws and Jaws As ghoul, but apply ghast fever instead of ghoul fever.
Consume Flesh Ȱɵ As ghoul, but it regains 1d6 additional Hit Points.

OVERSIZED THEMES
Giants are larger-than-life foes.
While many giants have themes
that tie them to elemental or
magical forces, the primary theme
giants share is that they embody a
classic cultural trope as their basis.
Fire giants, for example, can be
seen as oversized smiths, while
hill giants should evoke the
ﬂavor of an oversized bully.
Giant
Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout
the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.
Hill Giant
Selﬁsh and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately cowards.
Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages the
defenseless but is quick to ﬂee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better
organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of their
own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.

Throw Rock Ȱɵ
Wide Swing Ȱɵ The hill giant makes a single greatclub Strike and compares the attack
roll result to the ACs of up to two foes within its reach. This counts as two attacks
for the hill giant’s multiple attack penalty.
Stone Giant
Stone giants are stoic, reclusive herders and artists who have a rich
history and collection of traditions. They dwell in caves in tall
mountains and craggy ranges, where their grayish skin allows
them to blend in with their surroundings and go unnoticed by
imperceptive adventurers. Those benign travelers who come
across a tribe of stone giants need not worry much, however,
for stone giants do not actively invite confrontation or strife.
They are, by and large, a peaceful people who seek wisdom
through exploration of nature and long meditations on
the elements of the natural world. Their elders are the wisest of stone
giants, and use their charisma and druidic magic to lead their tribes to
prosperity and harmony with nature.
A typical stone giant stands 12 feet in height and weighs about
1,500 pounds.

GIMMERLING TREASURE
Gimmerlings collect weapons,
traps, mechanical novelties,
and dangerous magic items.
A gimmerling is likely found
with tools (like artisan’s tools,
repair kits, and thieves’ tools)
and items it can use to appear
more vulnerable, such as locks,
manacles, and snare kits (which it
feigns being trapped by).
Gimmerling
Gimmerlings are small, shapeshifting fey who stage ambushes to sate their
endless hunger and childish greed. These cruelly curious fey obsess over ﬁnding
and making unusual traps and sadistic weapons, and their favorite amusement is
seeing these traps sprung or the weapons wielded. When on the Material Plane,
they are frequently found in urban areas, particularly slums or other parts of
town where they can either go unnoticed or be easily forgotten—and have plenty
of victims to choose from.
A typical gimmerling disguises itself as an endangered child, doing so in hopes
of drawing creatures close enough to rob. The gimmerling puts itself in apparent
danger using a trap, construct, or bribed ally, or even a coerced monster like
a redcap (page 278).
Because gimmerlings sometimes trade obscure smithing or trapping techniques
in exchange for gifts that sate their curiosity, their greed, or their hunger, they
have at times been worshipped as minor gods of the forge. Some disciplined
gimmerlings work as honored artisans, elite guards, or spies for the demigods
known as the Eldest who dwell in the depths of the First World.

gimmerling’s treacherous aura. Eﬀect The triggering creature
must attempt a DC 32 Reﬂex save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The gimmerling
changes into its natural form or that of any humanoid. In humanoid form, it loses its
treacherous aura, and its equipment appears to be trinkets or toys. As a humanoid
that lacks claws or fangs, it loses the matching Strike. If it loses its claw Strike, it
gains a ﬁst Strike that is identical except that it deals bludgeoning damage.
Disarm ʚʖ Requirement The gimmerling’s last action was a success with a Strike
that has Disarm in its damage entry. Eﬀect The gimmerling knocks a held or carried
weapon to the ground in the target’s space.
Sneak Attack The gimmerling deals 2d6 extra precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
Trickster’s Step The gimmerling ignores diﬃcult terrain and doesn’t trigger traps with
its movement.
GIMMERLING LOCATIONS
Gimmerlings are more common
in the First World than on the
Material Plane and favor hunting
grounds on the verges of dangerous
places where they might encounter
protective creatures to mislead with
their disguises.

Gnoll
Gnolls are short, hyena-headed humanoids who dwell in warm grasslands,
savannas, and arid hills. Given their appearance, their afﬁnity for hyenas
should not be surprising; gnolls share their homes, food, and even many of their
own behaviors with these animals. Much like hyenas, gnolls have a notorious
reputation—they are known as bloodthirsty gluttons and slavers who worship
demons or other reprehensible powers. Though these rumors are often true, the
behavior of gnoll clans varies widely. Some groups are composed of capable
hunters who rarely clash with other humanoids unless there is a conﬂict over
territory. Others hew closer to the unsavory stories, preferring to raid settlements
and enslave innocents, snatching the fruits of others’ hard labor by strength of
arms and forcing their victims to perform the hard, demeaning labor necessary to
maintain the brutal clan.
Gnolls lack any particular reverence for the remains of the dead, which adds
to their reputation as scavengers or even cannibals. They willingly eat nearly any
other creature, including dead gnolls, which can evoke strong reactions from
people and cultures with a strong taboo against cannibalism or desecrating the
dead. To a gnoll, it is almost more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its
origin; gnolls see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging
world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the ﬂesh of a dead gnoll, which they
consider an insult to that gnoll’s memory and sacriﬁce and an implication
that the gnoll’s ﬂesh is unworthy of consumption. In fact, they refuse
to eat the bodies of particularly hated foes; particularly warmongering
gnolls even spike the bodies or heads of such despised enemies on tall
spears, which they place around their tribal holdings to dishonor the
dead and intimidate would-be invaders.
Gnoll women are far stronger and more aggressive than gnoll men
and are typically considered the leaders of their hunting packs and
clans. Though gnolls tend to be disorganized when it comes to
practical matters or negotiations, they are extremely efﬁcient at
working together to hunt down prey or overwhelm a group
of foes. Much like hyenas, they prefer to hunt in packs, and
are exceptionally skilled at setting up ambushes or separating
individual targets from larger groups.
Gnoll Hunter
Gnoll hunters serve their clans by hunting for food in
the wilds, marauding along well-traveled roads, and
tracking down escaped slaves.

GNOLL CLANS
The most commonly encountered
gnoll clans are slavers, who travel
far and wide to acquire chattel
and auction oﬀ their living goods.
Although not all clans engage in
slavery, most are still violent toward
other creatures in general. Some
clans hunt people for food, others
capture innocents to sacriﬁce to evil
deities, and still others simply wish
to wet their blades with blood.

GNOLL LAIRS
Gnolls dwell primarily on dry
savannas and windswept plains.
Thanks to their sturdy constitutions
and strong survival instincts,
they have few qualms about
setting up holdings out in the
open. Many gnolls establish their
encampments—typically made up of
hide lean-tos and tents—atop sloping
hills to better survey the region for
potential prey. Gnolls rarely dwell
in caverns or similar enclosures,
knowing that it is all too easy to get
cornered when there is only
one exit.
Gnoll Cultist
Gnoll cultists serve as their clans’ spiritual guides and conduits to the divine. As
often as not, their inﬂuence drives entire gnoll civilizations to commit atrocious
acts of violence and enslavement. Lamashtu and Rovagug are favored deities of
gnoll cultists, and many gnolls believe their kind was in fact birthed from the
womb of the Mother of Monsters. Some gnoll clans worship lesser-known demon
lords or entire pantheons of sinister patrons.

Gnoll Sergeant
When gnolls band together to form hunting or raiding
parties, the strongest among them is often designated the
leader or sergeant. These gnolls train extensively in the art of
war. Their skill at arms and the respect they command make
them powerful adversaries. In smaller clans or single family
units, a gnoll sergeant might also serve as the group’s leader
in other affairs, such as sorting out domestic disputes or
negotiating with rival gnoll clans.

GOBLIN TREASURE
Although goblin warrens are
generally ﬁlthy dumps, they
sometimes contain actual
treasures stolen from longshanks
or other goblin tribes. Typical
treasures include small pieces of
jewelry, shiny items such as hand
mirrors, and gold teeth. As they
rarely trust each other, many
goblins keep their most cherished
baubles on their persons; these,
might include useful weapons or
minor magic items.
Goblin
These small humanoids have green or gray skin and large heads with wide ears.
While some goblins are civilized and have worked hard to be considered upstanding
members of humanoid communities, most are impetuous and vicious creatures who
delight in wreaking havoc. These goblins think nothing of slaughtering livestock,
stealing infants, or burning down a building purely for momentary delight. They
revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call “longshanks.”
Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with
ﬁre; goblins who master magic or ﬁre earn great respect from their kin. Most other
humanoids ﬁnd it difﬁcult to understand goblins’ outlook: they hate canines but
eagerly share their lairs with so-called “goblin dogs,” they fearlessly attack larger
creatures but are terriﬁed of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles
a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices.
Goblin Warrior
The frontline ﬁghters of goblin tribes prefer to ﬁght in large groups—especially
when they can outnumber their foes at least three to one.

THE GOBLIN SONG
The following ditty is perhaps the
most infamous of goblin songs.
Goblins chew and goblins bite,
Goblins cut and goblins ﬁght.
Stab the dog and cut the horse,
Goblins eat and take by force!
Goblins race and goblins jump.
Goblins slash and goblins bump.
Burn the skin and mash the head,
Goblins here and you be dead!
Chase the baby, catch the pup.
Bonk the head to shut it up.
Bones be cracked, ﬂesh be stewed,
We be goblins! You be food!
Goblin Pyro
Some goblins take their people’s admiration of ﬁre fully into the realm of deadly
obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of goblin raiders
eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however, their presence
is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros sometimes lose
sight of their tribe’s goals and simply set ﬁre to anything that will burn—including
their own allies.

GOBLIN DOG STORIES
Goblins adore their goblin dog
pets, and crafting stories about
goblin dog antics is a time-
honored pursuit among many
goblin clans. Goblins often seek to
outdo prior stories by increasing
the audacity, ridiculousness,
and surreality of their tales.
Examples of popular goblin dog
tales include goblin dogs holding
fancy dinners in high society
among unwitting humans, goblin
dogs tainting dwarven ale in
unmentionable ways, and goblins
who transform into barghests
as a result of a goblin dog bite.
This last plot, in particular, has
some truth to it, as many credible
accounts point to the existence
of goblin dog werecreatures in
certain goblin tribes.
Goblin Dog
Goblins’ eponymous pets aren’t true canines at all, but rather large, blunt-nosed
rodents with thin bodies and long legs. As cowardly as they are ugly, goblin dogs
prefer to lurk behind bushes or in deep shadows, pouncing upon lone or wounded
prey. Goblin dogs frequently lair and roam in packs, but they are likely to ﬂee
from a ﬁght if injured, even if it means abandoning their pack-mates.
Goblin dogs take their name from their long association with goblins, who
breed the beasts as guard animals and mounts. Most goblins take issue with
the name, as the average goblin is appalled at the suggestion that these, their
favored mounts, have anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being
goblins, they haven’t bothered to come up with their own, unique name for
goblin dogs.
Even the most pampered goblin dogs have itchy mange and proliﬁc dander
that tenaciously affects those who come in contact with them. This “goblin
pox” causes itchy hives and festering sores that are as unsightly as they are
irritating and distracting. Goblin dog dander causes allergic reactions in nearly
all other creatures that don’t share the goblin dogs’ terrible hygiene—with the
notable exception, of course, of goblins, who remain entirely immune to the
disease regardless of cleanliness.
Hunger can drive goblin dogs to bouts of uncharacteristic violence; many
goblins purposefully starve their pets to make them more aggressive in battle.
Goblin dogs subsist on whatever organic material they can scavenge, and they
particularly enjoy fresh carrion. Although goblins are far from picky eaters,
they value goblin dogs as pets because the noisome animals will consume
food that even goblins won’t dare to eat. “Will it eat?” is one of several games
goblins enjoy playing with their goblin dog pets, where a wide range of mouth-
sized morsels (not always edible or safe to consume) are dangled before a
goblin dog’s snout. “Will it die?” is often a game played after “Will it eat?”
Goblin dogs who survive the second game earn renown for their digestive
prowess and often become favored tribal pets treated better than most of the
rank-and-ﬁle goblins.

GREAT GOGITETHS
As deadly as gogiteths are, rumors
persist of even more terrifying
threats known as great gogiteths.
Said to be nearly a hundred feet
across and capable of spawning
their own hordes of gogiteths in
reaction to being attacked, great
gogiteths are also reputed to be
unusually intelligent. The rumors
claim that great gogiteths are
largely content to lurk in their
deep, remote caverns and spend
the ages dreaming of sadism
and violence.
Gogiteth
A gogiteth is a slavering nightmare of teeth, eyes, and hairy spiderlike legs, and
its appearance is invariably seared into the minds of any who witness it. Hives of
these skittering monsters haunt the lowest reaches of the Darklands, competing
with cave worms and other subterranean horrors for food and resources. A
gogiteth is rarely seen alone, as these oversized vermin learned long ago that
the best means of survival is sticking close to others of their own kind. Even the
haughty drow know to seek cover when a gogiteth is spotted, for where there is
one, a swarm is sure to follow.
Gogiteths make a clacking sound as they move about. The joints in their many
legs pop and crack with each movement, though they can suppress this sound
voluntarily so that they can hunt without giving away their presence. The odd
creatures can also make a high-pitched whistling sound that echoes throughout
the caverns where they live. Some Darklands natives report that groups of
gogiteths sometimes join together in eerie, discordant songs.
Gogiteths’ alien anatomies have inspired no shortage of speculative origin
stories. Some believe they are the result of a ﬂeshwarping experiment gone
horribly wrong. Others think they may be related in some way to the Dominion
of the Black—possibly the distant cousins or some strange exile of that alien
entity; according to this mythos, once they made their way to this planet, the
gogiteths crawled into the depths of the earth, shying away from the blazing
sun above.
Gogiteths are a menace to every other denizen of the Darklands. Drow
and duergars in gogiteth-infested regions of Sekamina or Orv frequently
organize hunting parties to eradicate the terrors, even
calling for temporary truces with unlikely allies in times
when a gogiteth presence must be addressed. Since even
an average gogiteth hive can host up to two dozen of the
horrors, missions to eradicate them when they become
established are dangerous quests indeed.

FLESH GOLEMS
Few buyers want anything to do
with the remains of a destroyed
ﬂesh golem. An adventurer’s best
bet for proﬁting oﬀ of a ﬂesh
golem body is to disassemble it
piece by piece, extract the few
contraptions of steel and copper
meant to harness electricity, and
sell the parts to tinkerers who ask
few questions.
Golem
Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the
legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator’s commands—
often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator’s death. There
exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves
harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host
statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity
of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other,
less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue
to artiﬁcially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a
true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation.
Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem’s
unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from
these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difﬁcult to damage with weapons.
Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany
player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming,
expensive, and difﬁcult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even
hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called
“golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of
a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.
Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical
components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components
that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
Golem Antimagic
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other
than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few
types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are
listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block,
with the full rules appearing here. If an entry
lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”),
either type of spell can affect the golem.
•  Harmed By Any magic of this type that
targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage
has no type) instead of the usual eﬀect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of
magic of this type or is aﬀected by a persistent eﬀect of the appropriate type, it
takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
•	 Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem
lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell
would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of
magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.
•  Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes
it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual eﬀect. If the
golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it’s slowed 1
for that round.
•
Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more
speciﬁc spells, with the eﬀects described in its stat block.
Flesh Golem
Made of odd scraps of skin and muscle, a ﬂesh golem
is a grotesque parody of life. Though it has no mind,
it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving
it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard
the laboratories and charnel houses of ﬂeshwarpers
and necromancers who feel no compunctions about
desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the
ﬁrst ﬂesh golem is believed to have been a misguided

GRIKKITOG ORIGINS
Grikkitogs are the subject of
countless scary stories told among
denizens of the Plane of Earth,
many of which speculate upon
their origin. Some who remember
the wars between the elemental
lords believe the ﬁrst grikkitog
was an experiment created to
serve as a weapon for Ayrzul,
the evil Fossilized King of the
Elemental Plane of Earth, but its
hunger and power was so great
that it escaped containment,
infested an earth elemental
warden, and began to spread
throughout the plane.
Grikkitog
Grikkitogs, also known as “hungry earth,” are strange parasites from the Plane
of Earth that infest and possess earth, rock, and stone in order to feed their
endless hunger. A young grikkitog is a formless apparition until it corrupts an
earth elemental host, forming the grikkitog’s core. A grikkitog can then infest
the earth and stone nearby with its voracious essence, forming maws and eyes
all around it. These creatures are particularly dangerous to small creatures that
lair within gaps and holes among rocks, as well as mountain climbers searching
for the perfect handhold.

Implant Core ̂ˬ (manipulate) The grikkitog implants its core into an adjacent section
of earth or stone, melding seamlessly and changing its visual appearance to match
the surrounding rock. It’s immobilized but automatically succeeds at its Deception
check to Impersonate the stone around it; creatures actively searching for it can
still attempt Perception checks against its Deception DC as normal. A grikkitog can
release its implantation as a free action, which has the manipulate trait. A grikkitog’s
infestation aura and manifold vision are only active while implanted.
Manifold Vision While its core is implanted, the grikkitog can see through the eyes
it creates throughout the area of its infestation aura, gaining the beneﬁts of all-
around vision.

grikkitog infests all earth and stone within 120 feet, as long as there
is a contiguous physical connection between the earth, including
stone objects touching on the ground. This eﬀect spreads even if
the grikkitog does not have line of eﬀect, though it can aﬀect
earth or stone on the surface and exposed to the air only
if at least part of its core is exposed as well. Within the
aura, it can grow maws and eyes everywhere. It can make
jaws attacks against any creature, originating from any
earth or stone in the aura adjacent to that creature.

unless it succeeds at a DC 34 Reﬂex
save. While immobilized, the victim takes
3d8 persistent bleed damage and the
grikkitog feeds upon its ﬂesh. The creature is

DEAD MAN’S HAND
Decks of cards are a traditional
method used to tell a person’s
fortune, but legends hold that
certain cards or combinations of
unfortunate draws can attract
the attention of the grim reaper.
Specialized fortune-telling decks,
such as the Harrow, might
not feature the visage of the
grim reaper directly, but to the
paranoid, death could lurk in any
unfortunate hand of cards.
Grim Reaper
The Grim Reaper is the unﬂinching personiﬁcation of death. Silent as the grave and
as inevitable as time itself, this legendary being hunts down and ﬁnishes creatures
that have evaded death for far too long. Sometimes the Grim Reaper comes
without warning, while at others it comes to ﬁnish the work that other creatures
could not. The Grim Reaper serves no god, ﬁend, or aeon. It is both despised
and feared by psychopomps and celestials, but few—if any—dare to stand in its
way. Like some eternal plague, it kills those who try to cure the multiverse of its
presence. It stands alone and holds only its own council, and the pleading and
reasoning of mortals and immortals alike fall on deaf ears once the Grim Reaper
closes on its quarry. Its own reasoning is silent to mortal ears and inscrutable to
the mortal mind, but no matter the reason, the result is unyielding and ﬁnal.
While some legends hold that the Grim Reaper appears before everyone as
they die, the truth is quite a bit more disturbing. Such vigils in fact lie within the
providence of the psychopomps, a race of immortals charged with the protection
and guidance of mortal souls through the afterlife. The Grim Reaper has little
interest in protecting souls or guiding them. It is instead compelled by sinister
agendas arising within the nighted realm of Abaddon, where the Horsemen of the
Apocalypse rule. Indeed there are many similarities in shape and form between
the Grim Reaper and Charon, the Horseman of Death, but no recorded instance
exists of these two powerful entities working together. Instead, the Grim Reaper
serves as something of a manifestation of Abaddon itself, and in this regard is
believed by some to be an incarnation of the mysterious First Horseman. When
the Grim Reaper comes to a world, it does so not as an angel of mercy, but as a
relentless harvester of life. Those who fall to the Grim Reaper were not destined
to die as much as they were selected, hunted, and murdered.
Perhaps the most frightening legends surrounding the Grim Reaper concern
its nature as a singular entity, for some believe that more than one grim reaper
exists in the Great Beyond. These whispers tell of a cabal of at least nine of
these creatures that stalk reality, culling the living as inexplicable servants of
true entropy. According to the teaching of some death cults, the ﬁnal goal of the
Grim Reaper is to end the entire cycle of life and death and serve as a silent lord
of an empty universe.

GRIM REAPER TREASURE
The grim reaper keeps no treasure,
but sometimes lesser deaths hang
on to strange keepsakes from
those whom they have slain—
especially in cases where a lesser
death has set its unholy sight on
an extended family or faction.
Speed 50 feet, ﬂy 75 feet
Melee Ȱɵ keen scythe +40 (agile, deadly 3d10, magical, reach 10 feet, trip), Damage
4d10+23 slashing plus death strike and energy drain
Divine Innate Spells DC 47, attack +37; 10th ﬁnger of death (×4); 7th plane shift; Constant
(6th) true seeing; (3rd) haste; (2nd) see invisibility
Death Strike (death) A creature critically hit by any of the grim reaper’s attacks or that
critically fails against any of its spells must succeed at a DC 47 Fortitude save or die.
Energy Drain When the grim reaper hits and deals damage with its scythe, it regains 20 Hit
Points, and the target must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or become doomed 1. If the
target is already doomed, the doomed value increases by 1 (to a maximum of doomed 3).
Final Death A creature killed by the grim reaper can’t be brought back to life by any
means short of divine intervention.
Infuse Weapon (divine, evocation) Any scythe gains the agile trait, can’t be disarmed,
and becomes a +3 major striking keen scythe while the grim reaper wields it. If the
grim reaper Strikes a creature with a weakness to any speciﬁc type of damage, the
scythe’s damage counts as that type of damage, in addition to slashing.
Lesser Death
No one is quite sure what lesser deaths are, though some
claim that they are avatars of the grim reaper. Unlike that
strange hunter, however, lesser deaths hunt in packs on
rare occasions. More often than not, they manifest from
cursed magic items. Other times, they are just the enactors
of death, hunting in the same way the grim reaper does—
silently, with neither remorse nor quarter. Rarely, multiple
lesser deaths work together to cull a large population, their
scythes cutting through crowds and leaving entire cities
devoid of life, inspiring (hopefully) false rumors of
multiple grim reapers.

GUTHALLATH SLUMBER
Entire civilizations have been
swept oﬀ the face of Golarion due
to the devastating rampage of a
guthallath. But there is a light at
the end of the tunnel, for after
some time the guthallath ends its
massacre in a swift yet seemingly
random way. The colossus then
ﬁnds a remote location deep in the
wilderness, where it buries itself,
entering a deep slumber for years—
if not centuries—before awakening
and beginning the destructive cycle
once more.
Guthallath
A guthallath is an enormous construct created long ago by some unknown empire,
probably as a war machine. Nearly 100 feet tall, this massive stone statue typically
resembles a stalwart warrior wearing only a loincloth and skullcap. Few have seen
the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time such a relic is buried up to its
neck, covered in moss and stranded in some forgotten place. Yet, every so often, one
of these harbingers of destruction reactivates in response to some unknown stimulus
or rallying call, and when this happens, woe be unto any who stand in its way.
While the guthallath’s ancient enemies are gone, it is an engine of pure destruction,
designed to rampage for weeks or even months. While not intelligent enough to enjoy
or regret its acts, the guthallath cannot be reasoned with—it is unaffected by most
magic, and is unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and creatures it spares).

Erosion Aura (aura, primal) 120 feet. The guthallath erodes away the physical integrity
of all around it. Creatures and objects in the emanation other than the guthallath have
their hardness and resistances reduced by 10. At the start of its turn, a creature in the
erosion aura's area takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage (basic Fortitude DC 39).
Immunity to Magic The guthallath is immune to spells of lower than 7th level and the
activated eﬀects of magic items of lower than 14th level.

Innate Primal Spells DC 37; Constant (8th) true seeing; (3rd) haste
Annihilation Beams ʚʖ A guthallath releases two beams of destruction from
its eyes. Each beam is a 120-foot line.
Everything in either line takes the
eﬀect of a hit from a 10th-level
disintegrate spell (DC 41 Fortitude).
There is no additional eﬀect on
creatures in any area where the
beams overlap. The guthallath can’t
use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.
Deadly Throw Ȱɵ Requirements The
guthallath has a creature grabbed.
Eﬀect The guthallath throws the
creature into the air, 100 feet high and
50 feet away. If the ﬂung creature lands on
another creature, the creature it lands on takes
the same amount of bludgeoning damage. The
creature being landed on can attempt a DC 41
basic Reﬂex save.
Powerful Blows If a guthallath hits with an
attack and rolls a natural 19 on the d20 roll,
the attack is a critical hit. This has no eﬀect if
the 19 would be a failure.

HATERS OF HUMANITY
Hags loathe all humanoid races,
but not equally—the brunt of their
wrath is leveled against humans.
Hags prey on human society the
most, adding human ﬂesh to their
cauldron and snatching newborn
children before replacing the
babes with their own progeny as
changelings (page 62).
Hag
Malevolent crones who lurk at the edges of civilization, hags use their deceptive,
magical abilities to prey upon humanoids, manipulating and corrupting them.
Some say hags arose from fey that became twisted by their inner selﬁshness.
Hags gather together in covens for greater power, craft unique magical items
known as hag eyes, and are known to replace infant humanoids with their own
offspring—these children are changelings (page 62) who have the potential to
become hags themselves.
Sea Hag
Sea hags kill and eat ﬁshers and sailors who come near their lairs, torment coastal
dwellers with dark promises and vague threats, and enjoy the act of causing
distress and discord in small towns. They generally avoid making their lairs too
close to civilization, however, to avoid drawing enemies to their homes. Sea hags
are known for tempting desperate victims into tragic and inescapable bargains,
deals which the hag has already secretly stacked in her favor. Despite their
voracious appetites, sea hags appear hideously emaciated,
and unlike more powerful hags, they lack the ability
to magically disguise their form.
Sea hags can join covens, but their aquatic nature
often prevents them from joining mixed covens
with other kinds of hags.

Sea Hag’s Bargain (necromancy, occult)
The sea hag can make a bargain with
a willing creature, who must be of
sound mind. The creature gives away
a special or cherished quality—such
as its courage, its beauty, or its voice—in
exchange for a boon or a promise from the sea hag. As long as the sea hag keeps her
end of the bargain, the only way to restore the lost quality is to defeat the sea hag
or make another bargain for its return.

THE NATURE OF HAGS
Some believe that hags possess
no true form or body of their
own, but instead manifest from
society’s fear of aging. That no
known male hags exist has also
puzzled scholars, but perhaps
this is but another way in which
hags mock society—by presenting
themselves as awful stereotypes
of elderly women.

hag can cause a cage built of cold iron ﬁngernails to spring out of
nothingness at a range of up to 30 feet, attempting an Athletics
check to Grapple against the target’s Fortitude DC; if the target has a
weakness to cold iron, the annis hag gains a +2 circumstance bonus
to this check. Unlike a normal Grapple, the annis hag doesn’t need
to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful
attempt lasts until the creature escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to
crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by
attacking it. It has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The
hag can take on the appearance of any Medium female humanoid. This
doesn’t change her Speed or her attack and damage bonuses with her
Strikes but might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically to
bludgeoning).
Rend Ȱɵ claw
Night Hag
Night hags are thieves and merchants of mortal souls.
These foul creatures collect souls in dark gems or
crystalline jars to sell in ﬁendish markets, and are
themselves empowered by potent magic jewels known
as heartstones. They haunt the Ethereal Plane, where
they prey upon mortals in their dreams, debilitating
them with horriﬁc nightmares as they rest. A night
hag may ﬁnd a particular target and haunt them
continuously over the course of weeks, slowly and
cruelly breaking down the victim’s will and ability to
resist, until their soul is forfeit.
A night hag is a canny mastermind and soul broker, willing to
consider any deal as long as she is convinced she has the upper hand.
Although a night hag ﬁnds it easy to travel the Ethereal Plane and
prey upon helpless souls that can’t ﬁght back, these souls are also the
least desirable to the evil outsiders the night hag bargains with, and
so a night hag gathers allies and minions that allow her to prey on
more potent souls without personally risking herself. Their favored
minions are nightmares, with whom they share a special bond.
Above all, night hags avoid ﬁghting foes that can harry them on the Ethereal
Plane, picking ﬁghts only when they are certain they can escape.

OTHER GIANT LIZARDS
The three species of giant lizard
presented here are but the most
common of their kind encountered
in the wilds. Stories of much
larger lizards persist, including
the immense, 20-foot-long
monster known as a megalania,
a truly enormous version of the
giant monitor lizard capable of
swallowing creatures whole. Less
dangerous is the giant chameleon,
although its ability to blend into
its environs makes it a much more
insidious and stealthy threat than
the lumbering, mighty megalania.

Giant Frilled Lizard
Found in warm and tropical forests and savannas, these immense lizards are a
deadly threat to the unsuspecting traveler. When they aren’t sleeping or stalking
prey, giant frilled lizards bask in the sunlight for hours at a time. Explorers
sometimes mistakenly think them related to dragons due to their
large size, elaborate neck frills (which, when displayed in a show
of aggression and dominance, can be mistaken for wings), and
ferocious hissing vocalizations used to frighten away creatures
too large to eat.
A giant frilled lizard’s primary food sources are oversized
arthropods and other invertebrates, but it won’t hesitate to
augment its diet with vertebrates, including other lizards,
monkeys, and just about anything it can ﬁt into its
mouth—even humanoids. Although capable of short
bursts of speed, a giant frilled lizard normally lies
perfectly still while hunting, hoping to ambush
its prey.

LIZARDFOLK RELATIONS
Though most are neutral in
alignment, the typical iruxi’s pride
in their traditions, suspicion of
others, and need to protect their kin
can make them seem standoﬃsh or
even aggressive when encountered.
However, most are eager to learn
from visitors, trade stories
and equipment, and
forge alliances.
Lizardfolk
When human scholars speak of ancient civilizations, they usually turn their
focus to themselves, researching and lecturing on the ﬁrst human empires.
When they drift to others, they invariably look to cultures that had conﬂicts
or alliances with ancient humanity. That the culture of the people called
lizardfolk often gets ignored or forgotten even by well-meaning researchers is
thus no surprise, but to the lizardfolk themselves it is no matter. They know
their history and value its integrity and privacy—if younger ancestries like
humanity aren’t interested in learning from lizardfolk empires dating back
to before the ﬁrst human knocked two rocks together to make their ﬁrst
campﬁre, that’s ﬁne with them.
The word “lizardfolk” is an excellent example of humanity’s narrow-
sighted view of this culture. The name of their people is “iruxi,”
but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and
good-naturedly accepted the name “lizardfolk” as
a variant, and they generally resist urges
to call humans and other mammalians
similarly derivative names in return.
Iruxis dwell and thrive in all
tropical and temperate biomes, but
they are most at home in swamplands,
coastal regions, and riverlands, for they
are talented swimmers, and ﬁsh and
aquatic plants make up a large part of their
preferred diets.
Lizardfolk Defender
The lizardfolk defender serves as a protector of the young,
guardian of the settlement, and when no other options are available,
soldier in time of war. They eagerly rise to the defense of their kin but
do not revel in battle. An iruxi defender would rather turn back intruders
and allow them to ﬂee with the knowledge they were beaten, in hopes that
such word prevents further invasions, but they are not naive. The iruxi
understand the need for revenge, and when they allow a foe to escape,
they do not forget.

FROM THE DREAMLANDS
The nilith’s association with the
remote and little-understood
Dreamlands, also known as the
Dimension of Dreams, is unusual.
They draw power from a latent
dreaming connection to that
realm, but they are native to the
Material Plane.
Nilith
The sleek, dark niliths resemble hairless, emaciated tree sloths. These creatures
are intensely dangerous and fearsome, with red glowing eyes, wicked claws, and
mouths full of needlelike teeth. Niliths feed off the emotions, fears, and ﬂesh of
the living, and folktales posit that those who have nightmares of these creatures
are fated to one day be eaten by them. Niliths draw intense joy from tormenting
sapient creatures, often focusing their predations on the pious and the just, from
whom they draw forth their most basic fears and worst thoughts and revel in their
victims’ subsequent terror. More often than not, these despicable manipulators
wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack the
patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a
nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts
and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its ﬂesh and moving onto the
next victim.
Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant
dimension beyond dreams—in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding
machines for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected. Scholars
and dimensional travelers have attempted to uncover the exact mechanisms of
this mysterious connection, but they have yet to decipher the truth. Indeed, many
who investigate the nature of the nilith’s bond are driven to madness before
getting anywhere close. The odd connection to otherworldly beings might help
explain the longevity of these creatures, as it is believed that niliths can live for
thousands of years.
Thankfully for others, niliths are solitary creatures that hate the company of
their own kind, likely because these harbingers of nightmares have no wish to
taste the horrors they bring to others.

FILTH FLINGERS
Ofalths prefer to remain in their
middens and sewers, for in such
environs they have a constantly
renewing source of not only food,
but refuse to ﬂing at foes. An
ofalth encountered outside of
such wretched environs cannot
ﬂing rubbish as a ranged attack
unless it rips ﬁlth from its own
body. Each time it does so, it
takes 2d6 damage.
Ofalth
Found in castle dung heaps, city dumps, and sewers, ofalths are thought to be cousins
of shamblers. But whereas shamblers are living heaps of soggy vegetation, ofalths are
living heaps of matter from an altogether more unpleasant source: these monsters
look like 9-foot-tall amalgamations of wet detritus, sewage, and rubbish with long
tentacular arms and stout legs. It can be difﬁcult to tell where an ofalth’s body ends
and the foul contents of the cesspit they wallow within begins. They move through
refuse heaps in search of organic material in their endless quest to sate their hunger.
Though ofalths have a limited intellect, they still exhibit a vile curiosity. They
are no strangers to dissecting their prey after it has succumbed to their wasting
disease—a terrible and aptly named afﬂiction that causes the victim’s blood to
seep from its pores. When an ofalth manages to secure a victim alive, it may even
torture its food by consuming it bit by bit while it shrieks for mercy.
Ofalths’ domains typically overlap with those of otyughs, who fear ofalths, though
otyughs have also been known to band together in order to take down an ofalth for
its rubbery ﬂesh, which the otyughs consider an intoxicating delicacy. On the other
hand, ofalths seem to particularly enjoy taking otyughs apart one piece at a time.
They have been known to keep a captured otyugh alive for days or even weeks,
forcing the otyugh to endure the cloying scent of its own body decaying before the
ofalth feeds.

OTHER OOZES
Many varieties of these nearly
mindless predators exist in the
world. Some are mere variants,
with diﬀerent colored puddings,
jellies, and oozes with little to
diﬀerentiate them from those
presented here other than
their habitat. Others are more
specialized, or even dangerously
intelligent. The shoggoth
(page 297) is one such example,
but another variety of deadly and
powerful ooze is the thankfully
rare blight, a creature composed of
protoplasm and eyes that curses
entire regions with its presence.
ancient cultures would entomb bodies in stone sarcophaguses with ochre jellies to
allow the ooze to break down the ﬂesh and clean and polish the bones.

SHAMBLER TREASURE
Shamblers collect trinkets from
their previous victims and store
them in small hollows within their
bodies. They particularly prize
gems, but also like alchemical
or magical items that produce
electrical eﬀects such as bottled
lightning and shock runes.
Shambler
Shamblers are cunning carnivorous plants that resemble heaps of wet, rotting
vegetation. Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don’t have
much in the way of identiﬁable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that
lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful
blows. Sometimes called “shambling mounds,” these ambush predators have a
particular fondness for ﬂesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker
down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter
or soil, but won’t do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed
may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.
Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the
few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the
plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote
jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils
toward the sky to hope for—or perhaps to summon—intense lightning strikes.
Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical
strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of
raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor,
and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected
(and powerful) elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between
and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast
primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid
of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield
awesome powers over electricity.
Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed
not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known
as “spore mounds,” discharge clouds of toxic spores from their
bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like
plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock
formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and
inﬂict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.

INNATE SPELLS
A soulbound doll’s additional
3rd-level innate spell depends on
its alignment, as listed below.
Lawful Good: zone of truth
Neutral Good: heroism
Chaotic Good: heal
Lawful Neutral: nondetection
Neutral: wall of thorns
Chaotic Neutral: grease
Lawful Evil: chilling darkness
Neutral Evil: harm
Chaotic Evil: vampiric touch
Soulbound Doll
Soulbound dolls are eerie mannequins or playthings that have been imbued with a
small piece of a deceased mortal’s soul. These little constructs are created for a variety
of reasons—such as to serve as companions or servants—but their free will means
their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally
abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls,
and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll,
regardless of the construct’s alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond.
Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including
human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel
soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures
is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save
against the creator’s Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor’s
death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given
consent to such use before their death occurred.
Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some
sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment’s power makes the doll’s
ﬁst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the
doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy
and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their
crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such
as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities.
Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted
during or shortly after a person’s death, this doesn’t affect the deceased’s
resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal
to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of
more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment
of a living soul without repercussions.
The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem (Hardness 10) typically
embedded in the doll’s neck or chest. The soul fragment isn’t static, and
the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality
and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor’s or
moving farther aﬁeld on its own individual path. The soulbound doll’s
focus gem retains the doll’s memories even after the doll’s destruction.
The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed
into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of
soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.

SPRITE PRANKS
Sprite pranks tend to be
kind-hearted in nature; they might
use their abilities to embarrass
a braggart or to trick them into
a convoluted scheme to help
someone notice an admirer who
has been there for them all along.
Their plans are often half-baked;
sprites’ mercurial nature means
they can easily become distracted
by something new before following
through on a previous plan.
Sprite
Elusive, ﬂighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers ﬁrst imagine when
they hear the terms “fey” or “fairy.” While their dispositions vary from the
benevolent grig to the trickster pixie, all sprites share a connection to magic and
diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most
populous member, the common sprite.
Sprite
Common sprites are primeval guardians that latch onto a person, place, or object
and defend it for their own inscrutable reasons. Their dispositions vary from kind
to spiteful, but all sprites have a capricious streak. Being only about 9 inches tall,
they are wary of animals that might hunt them, particularly house cats, and prefer
ﬂight to a ﬁght. On the other hand, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms
of magic and heedlessly gather around ley line nexuses or other places of power.

Luminous Fire (evocation, light, primal) A sprite naturally sheds light like a
torch. The sprite can extinguish, rekindle, or change the color of this
light using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. While
this light is extinguished, the sprite’s Strikes don’t deal fire damage
and they can’t use their luminous spark Strike.

Grig
Grigs are kindly musicians of the fey,
often getting themselves into trouble due
to their penchant for confronting evil well
beyond their ability to vanquish. Even so, they
ﬁght bravely and with great cunning, using their
magic and ranged sonic attacks while ﬂying
and leaping using their wings and powerful
cricket-like lower torsos to stay out of reach.

VARIANT PIXIE ARROWS
Pixies can enchant their
arrows with a wide variety of
eﬀects, though nearly all such
enchantments are designed to
charm or bewilder, never maim.
Some arrows may emulate the
eﬀects of spells such as confusion,
fear, hideous laughter, and
even suggestion.
Ranged Ȱɵ dissonant note +9 (evocation, magical, range 30 feet, sonic), Damage 1d8 sonic
Primal Innate Spells DC 18; 2nd glitterdust, invisibility (self only); 1st illusory disguise;
Cantrips (2nd) ghost sound
Fiddle Ȱɵ (auditory, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A grig can rub its legs
together to create a catchy ﬁddling tune that compels others within 30 feet to dance
about, with varying eﬀects depending on a DC 18 Will save. A listener is temporarily
immune for 10 minutes on a success, but otherwise, if the grig continues to Fiddle
each round, the creature receives no additional saves.
Success No eﬀect.
Failure Flat-footed and –10-foot status penalty to Speeds.
Critical Failure As failure, and also slowed 1.
Pixie
Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish,
pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie
dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as
to defend themselves. Other creatures often have trouble
understanding a pixie’s rapid, rambling way of speaking.

Sprinkle Pixie Dust Ȱɵ (manipulate) The pixie
sprinkles pixie dust onto one of its arrows.
If the pixie hits a creature with that
arrow before the pixie’s next
turn, the arrow inﬂicts one of
the following special eﬀects instead of dealing damage.
Each eﬀect depends on the target’s DC 21 Will save. On
a critical hit, the target treats its save result as one
degree worse.
•	 Charm (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation,
mental) The target suﬀers the eﬀects of a charm spell, except it doesn’t gain a
bonus to its save if the only hostile act was the pixie ﬁring its bow, and the pixie can
choose to direct the target’s adoration toward another creature rather than itself.
•	 Memory Loss (divination, mental) On a failed Will save, the target loses the last 5
minutes of its memory.
•	 Sleep (enchantment, incapacitation, mental, sleep) The target suﬀers the eﬀects of
a 3rd-level sleep spell.
•	 Subdual (enchantment, mental, nonlethal) The target takes 4d6 mental damage,
depending on its basic Will save.
