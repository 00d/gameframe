Jungle Drake
Believed to be related to green dragons, jungle drakes are dangerous hunters
equipped with a debilitating venom delivered by a large barbed stinger or
their noxious phlegm. Their wings are equipped with vestigial claws that
allow them to deftly maneuver through thick jungle foliage both in ﬂight
and on foot. Jungle drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run
tactics, picking off the weakest members of a group and dragging their
victims off to ﬁnish their meals as they please.

DRAKE HUNTERS
The allure of hunting a dragon
is diﬃcult to resist for many
adventurers, but accomplishing
such a task is fraught with peril.
Unscrupulous adventurers have
been known to instead hunt drakes
and use trophies harvested from
these creatures to deceive locals.

Wyvern
A wyvern is a venomous drake with a well-earned reputation for impatience and
aggression. As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern’s
resilient body allows it to crash talons-ﬁrst into large prey without serious risk
to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with
searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks
the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to
lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before
it descends to pick apart the carcass.
Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature
typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or
demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and
tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by
the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment,
and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging
from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful
humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a
few weeks before the wyvern’s pride, malice, or insolence inspires
it to ﬂee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a
wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns
are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid
helping others.

ARE WYVERNS DRAKES?
Although commonly classiﬁed as
drakes, wyverns exhibit signiﬁcant
diﬀerences from most other types
of drakes. While scholars debate
the precise relationship between
them, none dispute that they
exhibit collegial behavior and
general deference to one another.

EFREETI MALIKS
Efreeti maliks take pleasure in
fulﬁlling wishes in pedantic ways
that cause suﬀering, regret, or
pain. A wisher for a thousand
pounds of gemstones might have
the gems delivered as a bone-
crushing avalanche. Efreeti maliks
add the following to their innate
spells: 5th ﬁreball (at will); 7th
volcanic eruption.
Djinni
Benevolent genies from the Plane of Air, djinn value art, culture, knowledge, and
trade. They also love new experiences, succulent dishes, and heady wines. Of all
geniekind, they are most likely to approach humans and other mortals, interacting
with them on friendly terms. Still, djinn are proud of their genie heritage and have
a tendency to be patronizing toward mortals, a habit that has earned them a
reputation for arrogance.
Djinn get along with jann and marids, but they ﬁnd shaitans too stiff and
harbor undying hatred for efreet. Although djinn are formidable combatants,
they despise war and prefer to eschew violence in favor of dealing with their
opponents using magic or subterfuge (making an exception, of course, when
they encounter efreet).

back 20 feet, or forces all creatures in the aura to move 20 feet
clockwise or counterclockwise. Each creature must attempt a DC 21
Fortitude save. On a success, it avoids being moved, and on a critical
failure it falls prone in addition to being moved. Creatures with the
air trait are immune.
Shaitan
Hailing from the Plane of Earth, shaitans are proud and brazen genies.
They value physical skill and love bargaining, games of chance, and working
with metal and stone. Immense gemstones and veins of precious
metal crisscross their home plane, and the industrious shaitans
have built a vast mercantile empire from these abundant
natural resources.

Griffon
Griffons are regal beasts revered as symbols of freedom and strength in many
cultures. They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion and the
head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle, but some
instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even osprey or vulture. In rare
cases, the griffon’s hindquarters may resemble those of a different great cat,
such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the environment
in which the griffon lives—for instance, the especially rare griffons of northern
Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy
owl—though this is not always the case. Some griffons lack wings altogether.
These wingless griffons, known as alces, result from a rare mutation. Among a
clutch of other griffons, the alce is typically considered the runt, so few of these
offshoots survive their ﬂedgling stage. Those alces that do make it to adulthood
tend to be tougher, more violent, and more aloof than most griffons.
Wild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen
eyesight to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground
and grab up their victims is shocking. They may tear open victim’s ﬂesh with
their razor-sharp beaks, but usually just take their prey to a high, secluded
location where they can enjoy their feast without interruptions. On the ground,
they take cover and leap out to ambush prey, then ﬂy off with their prize. The
exception to this is when a griffon is hunting to feed its offspring, in which case
it will almost never purposefully bring a living creature back to its nest for fear
of endangering its chicks.
Skilled animal trainers long ago learned how to raise griffons as mounts
for military forces or powerful individuals. Such mounts are known for their
strength, bravery, and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals
and possess a wisdom not normally afforded most animals; it is
thought that a griffon chooses its rider as much as a rider chooses
the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept and carry
a rider in ﬂight is a long and expensive ordeal. Griffon trainers
charge rich sums for their services, and a ruler who can
boast of owning a stable of griffons is the subject of great
respect and envy.

Flying Strafe ʚʖ The griﬀon Flies
up to its ﬂy Speed and makes two
talon Strikes at any point during that
movement. Each Strike must target a
diﬀerent creature. The attacks take the normal multiple
attack penalty.
Pounce Ȱɵ The griﬀon Strides and makes a talon Strike at the
end of that movement. If the griﬀon began this action hidden, it
remains hidden until after the attack.
THE FIRST GRIFFONS
The combination of two symbolic
and recognizable predators of
the land and air (the lion and
the eagle) is the result of devout
prayer among ancient cultures to
an equally ancient deity—a now
long-dead god named Curchanus,
who once held domain over the
beasts of the world. These ﬁrst
griﬀons were believed to be much
more intelligent and guardians
of the faith, but when Curchanus
was slain by Lamashtu,
the surviving griﬀons
regressed to little
more than beasts.
