Smilodon
Smilodons are large saber-toothed cats, apex predators that are signiﬁcantly more
muscular and broader than the other species of big cats. They often kill prey with
a quick stab to the throat or other vulnerable spot. The smilodon’s oversized fangs
are particularly sought after as trophies.

PRIMEVAL LANDS
Dinosaurs ﬁt well into certain
types of settings. They’re
often found in isolated lands
like primeval jungle valleys or
plateaus—regions known as lost
worlds for their inaccessibility
and lack of any encroaching
civilization. In addition to
dinosaurs, other megafauna
can exist in these places as
well, along with giant insects or
aggressive creatures like bulettes,
carnivorous plants, chuuls, and
drakes. Such regions can make for
perilous and intriguing adventure
sites, especially if you combine
them with ruins of ancient
civilizations to explore once the
party has navigated the hostile
wilderness regions.
against other triceratopses for grazing territory or mates. Short-tempered and
obstinate, triceratopses are unlikely to back down from a ﬁght unless they are
hopelessly outmatched, and the creatures are known to ﬁght to the death for
no apparent reason beyond stubbornness. Triceratopses often serve as mounts
for lizardfolk, orcs, and giants, who ride comfortably behind the dinosaurs’
protective bone frills. A triceratops is 30 feet long and weighs as much as 10 tons.
Triceratopses are surely the most well-known of the dinosaurs known as
ceratopids, but many others exist. For example, the smaller styracosauruses
have only one horn but several horn-like protrusions on their frills.

Brontosaurus
Brontosauruses are truly gigantic
behemoths, plodding herbivores
large enough to be unafraid of all
but the most massive predators.
Brontosauruses have stout bodies
and long, sinuous necks ending in
small heads, allowing them to graze
from the highest treetops. Their powerful tails are equally
as long as their necks and provide counterbalances.
Brontosauruses bear their bulk upon four stout legs.
Although their feet are capable of crushing entire buildings,
these herbivores are generally peaceful and considerate of
where they step.
Most brontosauruses are dangerous only when defending
themselves or their young, or when panicked enough
to stampede. When roused in this way, however, the
creatures are truly terrifying: their muscular tails sweep
in great arcs and their massive feet crash down
heedlessly onto the ground. A brontosaurus is 70
feet long and weighs more than 30 tons.

HOLLOW WORLDS
Another classic place that
dinosaurs are found in ﬁction are
in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign
settings might not contain entire
isolated worlds within them, but
many, such as Golarion, have
expansive underground lands. The
deepest region of the Darklands
of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is
an optimal place to ﬁnd a hollow
world. Typically infused with magic
that allows for jungles to grow
deep underground (and sometimes
even sunlike orbs that illuminate
the lands from above, simulating
a day‑night cycle), areas such as
Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect
places for dinosaurs to roam.
Brontosauruses belong to a group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, all of
which are immense in size. The brachiosaurus is among the tallest of these
dinosaurs, and the diplodocus among the longest, but it’s likely that even larger
behemoths exist.

Tail Sweep ʚʖ The brontosaurus makes a tail Strike and compares the attack roll to the
AC of up to three foes, each of whom must be within its tail’s melee reach and adjacent
to at least one other target. It rolls damage only once and applies it to each creature
hit. A Tail Sweep counts as two attacks for its multiple attack penalty.

Tyrannosaurus
Widely regarded as the king of the dinosaurs, the tyrannosaurus is a massive
predator with a wide mouth ﬁlled with viciously sharp teeth. Thundering
beasts of fury and hunger, tyrannosauruses are bold and fearless carnivores
that eagerly bite off great hunks of large prey and swallow smaller prey—such
as most humanoids—in a single gulp. Although they can subsist on
carrion, tyrannosaurs prefer live prey.
Tyrannosauruses stand on two wide, powerful
hind legs that allow them to run quickly,
and their thick tails provide them with

RABIES
While many societies adore dogs
and value them for their loyalty as
pets, no aﬄiction other than rabies
can reverse sentiments about these
creatures quite so easily. While
many animals can be aﬄicted with
this debilitating illness, something
about a loyal family pet growing
feral and violent as a result of the
disease makes it that much worse.

Dog
Dogs are trusted and loyal companions that serve as guardians, protectors, and
hunting companions. Their ability to detect prey or predators via scent and
their predilection to accompany humanoids makes them ideal pets for most
adventurers. There are hundreds of breeds of dogs in the world—from tiny
lapdogs who shower their masters in affection to muscular dogs that stand
nearly 4 feet high at the shoulder—and they can be found in nearly any place
where people reside. Larger breeds might even be used as mounts for smaller
adventurers, and some cultures use dogs as beasts of burden capable of pulling
sleds loaded with supplies across the icy tundra. Regardless, many adventurers
ﬁnd value in having a dog.
Guard Dog
The typical guard dog is loyal to and beloved by many communities. Often
adored as pets, they also excel as protectors and trackers, and can be fearless
when defending a beloved master or family member. The statistics presented
below work well for any number of breeds of dog ranging from 20 to 50
pounds in weight. Wild dogs can also use these statistics, but their untamed
nature makes them far more unpredictable and threatening. Feral dogs are
perhaps even more dangerous, for unlike their wild cousins, feral dogs often
lack the instinctual fear of humanity that stops wild creatures from interacting
with people.

Riding Dog
Riding dogs types include larger dogs, such as mastiffs,
wolfhounds, and huskies, and are bred often by halﬂings
and gnomes to serve as mounts. Riding dogs are as loyal and
devoted to their masters as guard dogs, and are ferocious
in battle, regardless of whether they bear a rider or not. As
with guard dogs, these large hounds can be wild or feral in
nature, and, in some cases, might rival packs of wolves with
regard to the danger they pose to inhabitants of rural areas.

LINNORM TREASURE
As with true dragons, linnorms
tend to amass immense piles
of treasure in their lairs. These
hoards consist of the weapons,
gear, and belongings of would-be
vanquishers more often than
minted coins or works of art.
Tor Linnorm
Tor linnorms dwell in the tallest volcanic mountains, either within natural formed
caverns or within molten craters. A tor linnorm’s temper can be as hot and
destructive as the magma the creature resembles.

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (evocation, fire, primal) The tor linnorm expels a 60-
foot cone of flame and ash dealing 20d6 fire damage to creatures
within the area (DC 46 basic Reflex save). At the start of the tor
linnorm’s next turn, the area affected by the breath weapon
is covered in thick, scorching smoke that burns both the
lungs and eyes, dealing an additional 10d6 fire damage
to all creatures in the area (DC 46 basic Reflex save).
A creature that spends an entire round in the smoke
with open eyes must succeed at a DC 44 Fortitude
save or is blinded for 1 minute. The smoke dissipates
after 1 minute; in strong winds, the smoke
dissipates in 5 rounds, and in

LIZARDS AND LIZARDFOLK
Giant lizards are often used as
mounts or guardians or kept
as pets, but never so often or
as traditionally as they are by
lizardfolk. The kinship these
people share with giant lizards
is unmistakable, valuing their
companionship to an extent that
equals or even exceeds that which
other societies have for popular
animal companions like dogs
and horses.
Lizard
Lizards have a wide range of appearances and abilities, but most share a basic
reptilian shape—long tails, wide toothy mouths, and four legs. While a few species
are capable of movement on two legs for short periods of time, most are strictly
quadrupedal. The three species presented here represent the most common and
well-known of the larger species.
Giant Gecko
These roughly human-sized reptiles have amazing feet capable of clinging
tenaciously to any surface. Giant geckos are typically docile and shy but can be
aggressive when cornered or defending their territory. These large-eyed lizards
are found in a wide variety of habitats, from rainforests and deserts to mountain
slopes or even underground caverns. They spend most of their time climbing
around in large trees or on rocky cliffs, whether hunting for small animals or
hiding from predators. A giant gecko’s scales are often quite brightly colored or
decorated in intricate patterns. Giant geckos span nearly 8 feet in length from
head to tail, and they weigh about 120 pounds.
Giant geckos are sometimes used by smaller humanoids as guardians
or mounts, as their docile nature makes them relatively easy to tame and
train. Their superior climbing skills make giant geckos particularly popular
within societies that dwell underground or near cliffs, such as goblins
and kobolds. Their bright coloration also makes them favorite exotic
pets in high society.

AC 16; Fort +6, Ref +10, Will +5
HP 20
Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +8, Damage 1d8+2 piercing
Giant Monitor Lizard
Large and seemingly ponderous, a monitor lizard
is a deceptively swift and ruthless predator. It
ambushes its prey by rushing out from cover and
biting the target with its powerful jaws. A giant
monitor lizard’s saliva is venomous, allowing it to
bring down prey larger than it can easily haul away
in its jaws. Giant monitor lizards grow up to 14 feet
long, including their long tails, and they weigh
about 350 pounds. Their bodies are normally
dark brown with patches of yellow or green.
When nesting, a giant monitor lizard digs
a deep burrow to hide in. The burrow serves
as both a safe haven and a location from which
the lizard can ambush larger prey such as deer,
boars, or even humanoids. A giant monitor
lizard can consume nearly its own body weight in
a single meal, and its loosely articulated jaws allow it
to swallow surprisingly large prey.

TEROTRICUS MYTHS
The Kellids of Sarkoris dealt with
their fair share of terotricuses
during the era of the Worldwound,
and these people developed
unique rituals to purify tainted
grounds with the help of ancestral
spirits and feathers acquired from
celestials. Far south of there, in
what is now known as the Sodden
Lands, wastelanders who learn of
the presence of a terotricus—or
“swampblight,” as they’re called
there­—carry lanterns blessed by
angels in the hopes that these
lights will keep the terotricus
at bay.
Terotricus
The legendary terotricus is a massive slime-mold that hails from the Abyss.
Its collective consciousness encapsulates entire regions, spreading as far as its
ever-growing cloud of spores will take it. Once it has seeped onto the Material
Plane from the Abyssal realm, a terotricus’s agenda is to feed on all living
creatures, infecting them with its spores, and its presence can spell doom for
any in its way.
Terotricuses move by rapidly expanding and contracting their slimy “bodies,”
which are capable of burrowing through soil, gliding across water, and
scrabbling up steep slopes. These behemoths of rot don’t need to travel to see
their plans come to fruition, though; their spores easily latch onto demons and
other denizens of the Abyss, who in turn bring this blight to the Material Plane
when the ﬁends are summoned.
When a terotricus infects a creature with its spores, web-like fungal growths
start appearing on the victim’s skin until they cover the entire body, at which
point the victim’s mind is also subdued and bent to the terotricus’s will. The
terotricus’s favored victims include animals, elves, and fey, though it is happy to
infect any creature it can catch. Cults of Treerazer occasionally attempt to make
contact with a terotricus, but such acts almost always simply result in a new sect
of spore-blighted slaves.

TREERAZER’S CULTISTS
Treerazer is worshipped by cultists
throughout the Inner Sea region.
The majority of these deranged
maniacs can be found within or
near the expanse of the Tanglebriar,
consisting of fungus-corrupted fey,
debased elves, or other sinister
demon worshippers. Beyond
Tanglebriar, his cultists are rarer
and tend to be loners or leaders
of very small groups. Treerazer’s
religious symbol is a bleeding dead
tree that’s been split in half.

demon lord. For now, even as a nascent demon lord, Treerazer is a dangerous foe.
Treerazer rarely leaves his swampy realm of Tanglebriar—a large thicket of
tainted foliage and rotting detritus just south of Kyonin’s Fierani Forest—but can
be encountered anywhere within that toxic mire, often accompanied by a small
legion of demons, corrupted fey, and other deadly allies. Certain occult rituals
have the power to call him forth from Tanglebriar, granting him the opportunity
to directly work his evils beyond the realm to which he has been exiled. Some
believe that no eldritch force contains Treerazer and that, were he willing, he
could travel Golarion with impunity, spreading the twisted blessings of his touch
and the corruption of his presence, yet the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is as cunning
and canny as he is deadly, and prefers to work his evils on the world from the
safety of his nightmare realm.

and die. Plant creatures take 20d8 negative damage with a DC 49 basic Fortitude save.
A creature that fails its save is doomed 1 for 1 minute and sickened 3. Treerazer can
choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this eﬀect, and generally does
so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants or fungi, or plant creatures that are allied to
his cause. Treerazer can’t use Defoliation for 1d4 rounds.

SPAWN OF CYTH-V’SUG
Treerazer was once the favored
minion and lieutenant (some
even say child) of the demon lord
Cyth-V’sug, Lord of Fungus and
Parasites. After a failed attempt to
wrest that role in the Abyss away
from Cyth-V’sug, Treerazer ﬂed to
the Material Plane. Cyth-V’sug was
unable (or perhaps only unwilling)
to pursue but took steps to ensure
that Treerazer would remain
there by exiling him, severing
Treerazer’s bond to the Abyss—if
the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is
slain, his animus will not return to
the Abyss and reform. Death, to
Treerazer, is a permanent thing.
Treerazer casts his innate dispel magic, targeting the creature he hit with his Strike or
one spell aﬀecting that creature.
Staggering Strike When Treerazer scores a critical hit with a melee attack, the target is
stunned 2.
Blackaxe
Treerazer’s favored and deadly weapon Blackaxe is a potent magical item known
as an artifact—a creation far beyond that of most mortals. Should Treerazer
be defeated and a PC take possession of Blackaxe, they claim the power of the
weapon. Such power comes with a price though, for Blackaxe’s inﬂuence will
drive any who claim it to perform vile deeds and, ultimately, may even compel its
user to restore a defeated Treerazer to power!

TROLL BLOOD
The blood of trolls is a valuable
and diﬃcult-to-procure substance
of intense interest to alchemists,
witches, and doctors the world
over. Though initially it is of little
interest other than its unnaturally
vibrant hue, when processed
correctly its applications are
numerous. Experiments have
produced oils that restore lost
limbs, potions that grant the
imbiber supernatural strength,
and even smoke bombs that cause
anyone caught in the haze to ﬂy
into an unstoppable rage.
Troll
Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description
for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’
capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline,
as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded ﬂesh in an instant,
and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really
understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it ﬁrsthand—a fate few
would wish even upon their worst enemies.
The ﬁrst thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures’
power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to
overcome it is to exploit the troll’s vulnerability to acid and ﬁre. It is not enough
to slay the troll with caustic or ﬂaming weapons, though—even the smallest
scrap of a troll’s ﬂesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The
only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster’s entire body
until nothing remains.
Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other
giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when
prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their
hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead
small tribes of trolls. Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead
their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence
permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem.
A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible
monster traditionally associated with the name to the
water-dwelling scrag and hybrid ﬂood troll. Regional
variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony
peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous—
but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and
insatiable thirst for blood.
Troll
Common trolls are dim-witted, gangly giants who
stalk the fringes of civilization. They rely on their
incredible strength to overpower foes with their
vicious claws and toothy maws. A troll’s endless hunger
drives it to consume all variety of living creatures, and it
is their ravenous eating habits that fuel trolls’ legendary
regenerative abilities. Trolls stand anywhere from 12 to
16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch for comfort and
to lull foes into a false sense of security.

TROLL AUGURS
Particularly devout trolls, called
augurs, claim to possess the
so-called “gift of sight,” which
they believe was granted them
by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs
practice a disturbing method of
future-telling, in which a troll
slashes open its own abdomen and
pulls out its entrails to interpret the
prophecies in its quivering innards.
Other cultists prod and agitate their
gutted diviner to keep it conscious
throughout the gruesome ordeal.
well beyond the typical life expectancy for their kind and rally others to follow
their lead. These champions develop a number of talents that make them
worthy leaders and potent hunters—namely their abilities to willingly boost
the rate of their regeneration and to shake off the acid and ﬁre that would
hinder it, not to mention a bestial roar that can send would-be predators
scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning far beyond their younger kin—
they know to keep their allies close, and their enemies even closer. If a troll
king so much as suspects that one of its followers is plotting to usurp it,
retribution is swift and fatal.

ALICORN
In alchemical and occult circles,
“alicorn” is the word for the
material that makes up a unicorn’s
horn, also used to describe any
object made from that horn. Note
that in many markets, alicorn sales
are illegal, and those who attempt
to sell alicorn are viewed with
repugnance—or worse.
Unicorn
Symbols of grace and purity, unicorns resemble proud and noble horses. They
are typically pure white of coat, but they are best known for the single, delicate
horn that extends from the center of their forehead. While unicorns often serve
as protectors of unspoiled wilderness and sacred places, they are themselves
highly sought after for their horns, which are said to possess potent magical
properties. To many, the mere idea of hunting such a magniﬁcent creature in the
hopes of severing its horn is utterly reprehensible. Indeed, a de-horned unicorn
is a sorry sight, and few such unicorns survive much longer in the wild.
Unicorns are found almost exclusively in remote, unsullied areas of wilderness.
Sometimes associated with good-aligned deities, other times associated with nature
and the fey, unicorns are always known for their righteousness and nobility. They
are wary, at best, of most humanoid creatures, due in large part for poachers’
tendency to hunt them for their horns, but unicorns are often rumored to have
a weakness for those who are pure of both heart and spirit. Despite some tales,
unicorns are equally likely to recognize purity in young men as in young women.
