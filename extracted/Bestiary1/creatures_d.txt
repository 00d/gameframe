# DAEODON
================================================================================

Boar Charge ʚʖ The boar Strides twice and then makes a tusk Strike. As long as it
moved at least 20 feet, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack roll.
Daeodon
Where the typical boar is merely ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the
towering daeodon is legitimately hateful and ruthlessly violent. Although
omnivorous, the daeodon (known in some regions simply as a giant boar)
prefers to feed on ﬂesh. Primarily a scavenger, the daeodon isn’t adverse
to attacking creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or
to protect any perceived encroachment into its lair or feeding grounds.
Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as
mounts or war-trained battle beasts; orc cavalry mounted on
daeodons is a fearsome force indeed.
A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet tall at
the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.

Daeodon Charge ʚʖ The daeodon Strides twice and then makes a tusk Strike. As
long as it moved at least 20 feet, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack roll.
A Medium or smaller creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 19 Reﬂex
save or be knocked prone by the force of the blow.
BOAR LOCATIONS
Boars can be found in almost
any environment, from forests to
deserts, warm or cold, including
even high-altitude mountainous
regions. They tend to prefer
forests, marshes, and meadows.
Daeodons are likewise found
in such regions but generally
prefer remote reaches far from
civilization.

BOGGARD VILLAGES
Boggards prefer to dwell in
swamplands and mires. Though
they are at home in the water, they
prefer to spend most of their lives
on land, and build villages of mud
huts. They often keep guardian
beasts, such as bloodseekers
(page 42), crocodiles (page 67),
giant frogs, or other feral animals
tamed (if only just barely) to serve
as protectors.
Boggard
Boggards are aggressive humanoid amphibians that thrive in swamps, marshes,
and even some rain forests. Boggards hatch from eggs into tadpoles, ﬁercely
competing for food and even consuming their siblings in that struggle. Over 3
years, the surviving boggards develops arms, legs, and lungs while learning the
rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfare—everything needed to survive in their
might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking
swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic.
Boggard Scout
Often tasked with patrolling the borders of their lands, boggard scouts learn to
speak another language (typically Common) to make it easier to issue threats and
insults toward trespassers.

LOST CIVILIZATIONS
Cyclopes dwell in or near the
remains of their lost civilizations—
notably Ghol-Gan in Garund,
Koloran in northwestern
Casmaron, and various kingdoms
in Iblydos. Ruins of Ghol-Gan
still dot the archipelago of the
Shackles, and untold numbers
of treasures belonging to the
ancient cyclops empire still await
discovery. Pirates and treasure
hunters regularly conduct
expeditions in search of lost GholGani relics, but many of these
voyages never return. Among
those that do, survivors speak of
terrible curses, gruesome traps,
and one-eyed undead guardians.
Cyclops
The cyclopes are violent giants with a tragic past. Although they possess only
one eye, they could once see far more than most, possessing occult wisdom and
divinatory magic that gave them the mystic ability of foresight. But their legendary
oracular powers failed to prevent the fall of their society, and the vast kingdoms
of the cyclops long ago collapsed into ruin. Today, cyclopes have forgotten much
of what they once knew, and they skulk among the crumbling remains of their
fallen cities like forgotten kings and queens gone mad.
Cyclops
The kingdoms of the cyclopes date to an age before the rise of humanity,
when dragons and giants and serpentfolk ruled the world. The cyclopes built
enormous stone cities and prayed to ancient gods of brutality and wrath, but
their power to foresee the future failed them, and their civilization collapsed.
Today, most cyclopes have virtually no knowledge of the former glory of their
kind, even though it is not uncommon for
them to dwell among the ruins of their
greatness. Cyclops cities include monuments
and imposing murals which depict their
peoples’ history, but few now among them can
read or interpret these relics of the past.
In addition to their single eye, cyclopes are
also famous for their never-ending hunger, an
appetite so all-consuming that some scholars
theorize it may in fact be some kind of
curse. The ever-present hunger of the
cyclopes seems to have some connection
to the death of their civilization—though
whether this voracity was the cause or a
side-effect of their people’s downfall is likely
destined to remain a mystery.
Although details of the cyclopes’ gods have
largely been lost to the annals of time, what
little is known about these deities suggests they
were vindictive and petty enough to curse their
own people if they felt neglected or badly served.

# DEEP GNOME SCOUT
================================================================================


Bestiary
Deep Gnome
These distant cousins to gnomes are reclusive, underground dwellers.
Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or
brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray
hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep
gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely
interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are
slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to
prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement.
The ﬁrst deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their
early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group
of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and
it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the
gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey
who might inﬁltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons
for the gnomes’ relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands
of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed
the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep
gnome of today.
Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at ﬁrst glance, they
retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more
emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what
seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an
extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are
close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require
to process their feelings.
Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby duergar
(pages 138–139) communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even
religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved
into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor
duergars are particularly proud of these conﬂicts, but both insist they were in
the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars ﬁght has left
a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities,
leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even
more than other strangers. This can result in non-duergar dwarves
being driven off from deep gnome cities before being able to explain
themselves. A dwarf and even those traveling with a dwarf require patience
and tenacity when attempting to deal with deep gnomes holding such views.
Svirfneblins value crafting and many decorate their cavernous homes with
paintings on the walls, often incorporating the rock in clever ways. They also
value crystals and gems, making jewelry and beads that they string through
their hair.
Deep Gnome Scout
Deep gnome scouts patrol the tunnels that lead into their
settlements. Some scout alone to make the most of their
stealth, but others form groups for the sake of safety.

DEEP GNOME FAITH
While most deep gnomes aren’t
particularly religious, they respect
the spirits of nature, especially
those found within earth and
stone. Most deep gnome druids,
known as “rockwardens,” learn
Terran, the language of the Plane
of Earth, in order to speak with
these forces, and some can even
entreat with earth elementals.
The handful of deep gnome
communities of faith tend to
worship neutral deities, such
as Gozreh, Nethys, Pharasma,
and the gnomish goddess Nivi
Rhombodazzle. In such areas, a
small church to the worshipped
god is erected in the center of
town and is open to the public
around the clock, allowing the
deep gnomes to worship as they
see ﬁt.

DEMONIC DEITIES
The most powerful demons are
known as demon lords (the term
is gender neutral in this case).
Of these divinities, Lamashtu is
the most powerful. Countless
other demon lords exist, including
Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri,
and Zura.
Demon
When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a
deadly ﬁend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic
sins like wrath or gluttony, or more “specialized” depravities like an obsession
with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon’s driving
goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal
souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a neverending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Abyss.
Quasit
Unlike other demons, quasits are formed when a mortal spellcaster sheds a portion
of their own sinful soul to create a familiar or companion. When these quasits outlive
their creators, they become free willed and seek methods of returning to the Abyss,
a task that requires pledging servitude to more powerful demons, so many quasits
instead opt to remain on the Material Plane to promote evil and hope for chance and
luck to someday provide them with a method of reaching the Abyss on their own.

# DERO STALKER
================================================================================


Bestiary
THE SUN! IT BURNS!
Deros are ﬁxated with curing their
allergy to sunlight. To understand
how the surface dwellers can
withstand the light of the sun,
deros conduct late-night raids on
surface cities, abducting victims and
performing terrible experiments on
them. Those who survive are often
returned with much of their memory
erased and their bodies bearing
mysterious scars. When these
repressed memories surface, they
lead to wild, hazy recollections of
being abducted.
Dero
Deros are short, wiry humanoids with milky white eyes, gray-blue skin,
and wild shocks of off-white or gray hair. The descendants of a mysterious
type of fey abandoned in the deepest, darkest caverns of Golarion, deros are
the subject of fearful legends and folk tales to most of the world’s surface
races. They skulk beneath major metropolitan areas, performing cruel and
twisted experiments on unwilling subjects. A dero is 3 feet tall and weighs
approximately 70 pounds.

Dero stalkers are those charged with exploring the surface world by night and
seeking out new victims to abduct.

CYTILLESH
Deros grow and ingest a poisonous
fungus called cytillesh, also known

a pale blue glow and can cause
birth defects and various adverse
eﬀects. Deros aren’t fazed by these
detriments, as prolonged exposure
can also slow the eﬀects of aging

Aklyses
The aklys is a throwing club with a hook on one end and a lengthy cord attached

ranged trip, tethered, thrown 20 feet, and trip weapon traits; the new traits are
described below. Though aklyses aren’t available in most shops, one might be
purchased for 5 gp from a vendor that specializes in strange weapons.
Ranged Trip: This weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill at a distance
up to the weapon’s ﬁrst range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance
penalty. You can add the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the
check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn’t deal any damage
when used to Trip. This trait usually only appears on a thrown weapon.
Tethered: This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you
to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand while wielding
this weapon, you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your
grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed
(unless it is being held by another creature).

Devil
Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal
life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout
all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted
by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered
pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who
succumb to these temptations ﬁnd themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless
torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of
being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a speciﬁc
role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell,
from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly
lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized
devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit ﬁends command
entire infernal armies.
Lemure
These shapeless masses of quivering ﬂesh are the least of devilkind. Pathetic creatures
from Hell’s ﬁrst layer, lemures roam alongside damned and suffering souls. Pit
ﬁends can combine the essence of a mob of lemures to concentrate their collective
wickedness with a single form, granting it an infernal sentience and transforming it
into a more powerful devil (see the pit ﬁend’s Devil Shaping ability).

# DEZULLON
================================================================================


Bestiary
DEZULLON VENOM
The dezullon is most well known
for the psychoactive eﬀects of
its secretions. Aﬀected creatures
suﬀer amnesia, brieﬂy forgetting
where they are and why they are
in pain. Some creatures, desperate
to escape the past, willingly
expose themselves to a dezullon’s
amnesia venom in an eﬀort to
make their painful memories fade.
Dezullon
Dezullons are dangerous carnivorous pitcher plants that dwell in forested
regions with thick canopies. They hunt for meat along the forest’s understory
when not sunning themselves in the boughs above. Dezullons are smart enough
to notice that some creatures are attracted by shiny things, and sometimes use
such objects to set up ambushes. To assume that the dezullon’s ambulations are
slow simply because the creature has a root structure is a foolish mistake; many
an adventurer has been crushed to death by this surprisingly agile plant. In
addition, these dangerous plants are expert climbers, making their pursuit even
more difﬁcult to escape from.
A hungry dezullon keeps prey off-balance by spilling its putrid, psychoactive
digestive juices from its central pitcher. In addition to being highly acidic, the
enzymes in a dezullon’s digestive tract, once expelled, inﬂict a victim with powerful
hallucinations and amnesia. This secondary effect makes dezullons highly sought
after in some circles, including avid drug users, experimental doctors, and
criminals who deal in poisons.
Many varieties of dezullon exist, including lumbering giants of
incredible size, those that have tiny, cup-shaped pitchers that
proliferate along lengths of creeping ivy like suckers on a squid’s
tentacles, and others with hundreds of blood-red, razor-sharp
leaves that protrude from the inside of their pitchers like
a leech’s teeth. This latter variety is especially dangerous,
since the leaves can all but eviscerate creatures that become
ensconced inside their pitchers.

in urban areas, though some more
reclusive individuals claim ruins or
dungeons as their domains.
Dhampir
As the mortal offspring of a vampire and a living parent, dhampirs occupy an
unusual place among the living. Their vampiric parentage lends them elongated
incisors, an unearthly beauty and physical grace, a ghostly pallor, and a piercing
gaze. Perhaps their most distinctive feature, however, is their connection to
negative energy, which heals them, leaving them as vulnerable to positive energy
as any undead creature. Though they don’t suffer the full range of a vampire’s
vulnerabilities, they do share certain characteristics with their vampire parent,
leading to several distinct dhampir heritages across Golarion. By far the most
common dhampirs are svetocher, the children of the more common moroi vampires.
Many dhampirs lived their childhoods as orphans, often because their mortal
parents believed their child to be cursed and abandoned them, or perished
as a result of a difﬁcult childbirth. Often outcast, some dhampirs leverage
their charisma and personal magnetism to manipulate those around them,
while others struggle to form relationships. Frequent mistrust of a dhampir’s
parentage present further challenges when dhampirs attempt to integrate into
mortal society. Those who seek out their vampiric parent instead often ﬁnd
themselves considered inferior, rejected as they were with regular mortals
but for different reasons. But in regions like Nidal, Geb, and Ustalav, where
vampires themselves carry some degree of respect, dhampirs can sometimes ﬁnd
their heritage empowering.
Dhampirs ﬁll countless roles within many communities. Some prefer to blend in
as best they can, holding regular jobs and building families (most children born
to dhampirs share an ancestry with the dhampir’s mortal parent, but a rare few
are born as dhampirs themselves). Those who learn to make the most of their
inherited charm can achieve a high societal status, whether leveraging traditional
avenues of power or gathering followers enamored by the dhampir’s abilities.
With a lifespan rivaling that of an elf, a dhampir can develop extensive
inﬂuence and engage in long-reaching schemes of massive scope. Further, their
ancestry lends them a proclivity to necromancy and the occult arts.

DINOSAURS IN FANTASY
At ﬁrst glance, the inclusion of
dinosaurs in a fantasy setting
might seem strange, but dinosaurs
are an excellent creature to use
in a game that bridges the gap
between familiar real-world
animals and legendary monsters.
If having dinosaurs mix freely with
lions, manticores, and dragons still
seems strange to you, consider
having them dwell in remote,
primeval lands, as suggested in
the sidebars on pages 99–100.
On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in
the wilder regions of the world,
particularly on the continent of
Garund, though they are common
enough that PCs might ﬁnd some
on display in a menagerie in a
northern city, in use as guardian
creatures, or even kept by druids
as loyal animal companions.
Dinosaur
Remnants from the world’s primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still
exist in large numbers in isolated and remote wildernesses or far underground
within magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous
humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals.
Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it
to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such
activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and
other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take
them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond
their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping
into the wild.
Velociraptor
A smaller cousin of the deinonychus, the velociraptor is a swift, cunning
pack hunter. It has no fear of larger creatures, and a group of these dinosaurs
won’t hesitate to attack creatures the size of a horse. Velociraptors are social
animals, and tend to live in groups of up to a dozen other velociraptors. They
have manes of feathery plumage that extend down their backs and along the
sides of their arms, legs, and tail, while their underbellies and ﬂanks are scaly.
These feathers allow them to blend into their natural terrains with ease, but
when excited, attempting to intimidate, or seeking a mate, a velociraptor can
puff and frill this plumage to expose much brighter colors normally covered
by the longer feathers. A typical velociraptor is 1-1/2
feet tall, 7 feet long, and weighs 35 pounds.

================================================================================
# DEINONYCHUS
================================================================================


DINOSAUR RESOURCES
As animals, dinosaurs have little
interest in treasure (although
velociraptors and deinonychuses,
like their bird cousins, enjoy
keeping sparkling baubles in
their nests), but the remains of
adventurers strewn about their
lairs often still have valuable gear.
Dinosaurs can also be harvested
for rare and valuable trophies such
as teeth, talons, armor plates, and
the like.

Ankylosaurus
Squat, heavily armored quadrupeds, ankylosauruses are stubborn and irascible.
Although they’re herbivores, they have been known to attack other creatures that
trespass within territory simply out of ill temper.
Ankylosauruses have few natural predators, as their bony hides are covered in
spiked nubs that jut in many different directions to discourage larger creatures
from biting them. They have mighty tails ending in an immense knot of bone,
which they use to whip at threats with incredible speed and power. While these
low-to-the-ground dinosaurs can trample human-sized or smaller foes, their
relatively squat stance prevents them from doing so against larger targets. An
ankylosaurus is about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs over
3 tons.
The ankylosaurus is the largest of the heavily armored dinosaurs called
ankylosaurids, but smaller versions exist as well. Still Large in size, these smaller
dinosaurs, such as the 16-foot long pinacosaurus, lack the trample ability and
are rarely above 4th level. Regardless of size, ankylosaurids tend to be relatively
muted in coloration, with mixes of black, brown, and gray. When captive, an
ankylosaurus’s keeper might paint its scales bright colors to signify to others
that is not a wild creature.

Dragon, Chromatic
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the
strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly
feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each
color of dragon unleashes its own ﬂavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw,
tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful
as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary.
Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved
and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Shape-Changing Dragons
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to inﬁltrate settlements or
inﬂuence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape Ȱɵ (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on
the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or
attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its
Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Chromatic Dragon Spellcasters
Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that
type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy
and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You
can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the
same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s
Intelligence or Charisma modiﬁer by 1 or 2 to reﬂect its mastery of magic.
Chromatic Dragons of Golarion
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and
sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are
no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share
their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen
of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that
they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich
mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic
and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the
wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the
sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of
the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly
in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a
wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the
Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea
region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range
in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they
threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
Black Dragon
Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their
domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities
from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightningquick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their
breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except
perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.
Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow
them to breathe water. Their frills and ﬁns make them accomplished swimmers, well
suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the
fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.

She knows something darker even
than herself resides somewhere in
the swamp, but she has yet to ﬁnd
how to summon such an entity. For
now, she slumbers, waking only to
demand sacriﬁces.
Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The ﬂoors are littered with rotting
meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid
twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes,
and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do
with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure
hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer
substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.

Bestiary
Dragon Turtle
When sailors warn others of the terrible threats of the open sea, they seldom
forget to mention dragon turtles—immense aquatic dragons with rocky
shells similar to those of tortoises and ﬂippers powerful enough to overturn
hardy vessels. These fearsome creatures enjoy being considered as dangerous
as storms or natural disasters by seafaring folk. Dragon turtles delight in
amassing treasure, although most prefer to receive tribute from passing sailors
and often store their hoards in the shipwrecks of vessels once crewed by those
unwilling to surrender their valuables. Dragon turtles are solitary creatures
and hunt in regions encompassing a hundred square miles or more. Although
they normally eat large ﬁsh, they are omnivorous and also eat seaweed or even
foolhardy dragon hunters. Experienced sailors keep a keen eye out for dragon
turtles, preparing to ﬂee should one approach or offer it treasure in exchange
for safe passage.
Most dragon turtles are at least 20 feet wide and 50 feet long, although
some can grow substantially larger. These massive, ancient dragon turtles are
somnolent, and resemble rocky islands from a distance; their prodigious hoards
can be a source of truly ancient sea lore. Legends persist of truly immense
dragon turtles who spend centuries drifting on the surface of the ocean, far from
established shipping lanes or charted waters, with shells that serve as islands
capable of supporting entire ecosystems and even, some claim, small settlements
whose inhabitants know nothing of land that doesn’t drift across the sea.

DRAKAUTHIX SPORELINGS
When a new drakauthix bursts
forth from a spore-infested corpse,
it has no true way of defending
itself. However, a sporeling does
not need to hunt until it grows
much larger. Each sporeling
harvests enough material from
the body it emerged from to grow
to its full size over a few short
days. After it has done so, the
drakauthix detaches from the cave
ceiling and, starving, immediately
seeks out its ﬁrst meal in the
cavern below.
Drakauthix
The drakauthix is a massive fungus that ﬂoats through the heights of the largest
Darklands caverns, propelled by bladders that spray air and spores. A voracious
but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures
from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed.
The drakauthix’s digestive process is entirely external—it clings to victims,
and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the ﬂesh before
the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground
below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called
sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling
and grow.
The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals,
and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing
on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems
it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix
drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal.
The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a
grudge and simply slithers off to ﬁnd a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest
the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn’t above feasting on more active
prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for
danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.
Some Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for
their ﬂesh, which has a unique ﬂavor with a peppery aftertaste. Subterranean
races also make ink from drakauthixes by burning their carcasses, then grinding
and pressing the ashes for a long time until a silvery substance congeals.

DRAKE ECOLOGY
Drakes reach maturity and
reproduce much earlier than
dragons, meaning that they are a
far more common threat than their
more powerful forebears. Drakes
have few qualms about dwelling
with one another (provided they
are the same species), often
establishing dens in pockets of
wilderness suitable to their needs,
such as swampy grottoes, shallow
shoreline caves, or cliﬀside perches.
Drake
Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct—drakes are primitive draconic monsters
who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of their larger cousins but little (if any)
of the cunning. While they’re weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than
dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around
them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups ﬁttingly
called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of
river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of
desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one
species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes
lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails
with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid
close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in
wide swaths from comfortable distances while ﬂying overhead. Finally, all drakes
have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to
perform incredible feats of speed.
Drake Eggs
While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized
creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components
in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for
drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.
A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3
to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to
their natural environment, perhaps the most difﬁcult aspect of drake husbandry.
While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle
drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes
(which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of ﬂame and frost
drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difﬁcult
to replicate safely.
A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The
coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly
from one species to the next. A creature
must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check,
or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to
identify the drake species of a
speciﬁc egg.
Once
a
drake
hatches, it imprints
on the ﬁrst creature
that it sees. A creature imprinted on in
this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature
checks to train or command that
drake. The market price of a drake
egg varies depending on the region, the type
of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has
in mind, but typically depends on the level of
the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous,
and intelligent creatures, many societies do not
condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize
those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full

or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers
are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconﬁdence,
or general lack of skill.

DRAKE TREASURE
Drakes share dragon’s interest
in treasure, but lack dragons’
discerning taste. A drake hoard
will certainly contain coins,
jewelry, gemstones, gear, and
even the odd magic item or
two, but the bulk of the hoard
invariably consists of broken
weapons, shiny rocks, bits of
junk, and other doubtful
pieces of refuse.
River Drake
Although the glistening scales and sleek, ﬁn-like wings on these drakes give them
an appearance reminiscent of river ﬁsh, they are actually distant relatives of the
black dragon. While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable
of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water’s
surface. This ﬂexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from ﬁsh and
boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.

# DESERT DRAKE
================================================================================


Desert Drake
Distant cousins of blue dragons that lack their relatives’ magical talents and
intelligence, these desert-dwelling drakes are nonetheless dangerous ambush
predators, preying upon isolated desert travelers and outposts for food and
supplies. They retain their true-blooded forebears’ resistance to electricity and
afﬁnity for sandy environs. Desert drakes’ scales range in coloration from rustbrown to light tan and ocher shades, mimicking the colors of the dunes they
call home.
Desert drakes are among the lightest and most compact of the drakes, though
this shouldn’t be mistaken for frailty. Their swooped-back horns and featherthin wings are adapted to make burrowing as easy as possible. Indeed, a desert
drake’s powerful neck makes wriggling through sand and other loose scree as
easy as walking for it.

OTHER DRAKES
The drakes presented on these
pages are far from the only types
that exist. Forest drakes have green
hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be
found in temperate woodlands. Rift
drakes, among the most powerful
of their kind, spit clinging caustic
vapors and dwell in badlands and
regions scarred by devastating
magical disasters. Sea drakes can be
found in oceans across the world,
lava drakes in volcanic crevasses,
mist drakes along coastlines and in
salt marshes, and spire drakes in
ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly,
many other types of drakes lurk in
the far corners of the world!

Drow
The ﬁrst drow were elves who ﬂed into the depths of the world from a devastating
cataclysm thousands of years ago. In their journey below, they fell to bickering
and in-ﬁghting, drawing the attention of sinister intelligences beyond their own.
Whether it was the inﬂuence of a speciﬁc demon lord, the Rough Beast Rovagug,
or some other fell force is unknown, but in that time the elves transformed both
spiritually and physically, tainting their hearts with desires for cruelty, sadism,
and violence. The hues of their eyes became sinister red or bleached white, and
their ﬂesh adopted an unearthly lavender sheen that made the drow instantly
recognizable. The drow also developed potent magical abilities and resistances
that further empowered them, if at the cost of their souls.
Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently
dysfunctional society, inﬂuenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on
providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many
of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a speciﬁc
demon lord patron—but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to
bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn’t simply
consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one’s superior—be it a
teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships—is the real bond
holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest
drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike.
The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed
stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends
crafted to share around a campﬁre. Today, the existence of drow is an understood
truth, and while their presence in the dark caverns deep below is unsettling, they
seem content to leave the surface world alone for now.

While drow society is evil, not all
drow are bound to these norms.
Those who seek something
better in life are invariably exiles
and often flee to the surface to
escape their sinister kin. These

they seek out societies where
others have yet to hear the
legends regarding their kind.

OCCULT TRADITIONS
Unlike classical dwarven
practitioners of magic, duergars
have embraced the practice of
occultism. All duergars have at
least a few innate occult spells,
primary among them being the
ability to magically increase their
size. This power not only aids
them in intimidating and bullying
their slaves, but also serves as
a potent combat option against
their many enemies.
Duergar
Deep beneath the surface, duergars stubbornly claim the ancestral subterranean
homelands of the dwarves as their own, having refused to venture to the
surface along with their modern dwarven cousins. An exiled dwarven deity
named Droskar offered duergars salvation from the horrors of the Darklands,
and in exchange duergars endlessly toil in his honor within their subterranean
empire. Notorious slavers, duergars regularly raid other Darklands settlements
as well as surface communities in constant search of living beings to task with
endless amounts of work in their harsh and exhausting settlements.
Duergars are gray-skinned creatures, often referred to as “ashen” by those
surface dwarves willing to speak of them. These subterranean dwarves have a
strong natural connection with cave-dwelling vermin, and it’s common to see
duergar caravans drawn by teams of immense beetles. Most duergars devote
themselves to the worship of Droskar, a taskmaster of a god who demands
back-breaking toil in addition to regular prayer. Duergar leadership often
consists of powerful divine servants of Droskar, along with incredibly stout
warriors whose martial prowess ensures they can overcome any direct threat
to their rule. Almost every aspect of duergar society is controlled by a strict
hierarchy of leadership, with taskmasters directing subordinates across all
walks of life.
Duergar Sharpshooter
Duergar sharpshooters serve both as ranged support for slaver parties and
as snipers posted on towers overlooking quarries and other areas where
enslaved workers toil away the hours. Duergar sharpshooters also specialize
in nonlethal methods of ranged combat—tactics they are often called upon to
use when quelling slave riots or capturing escaped slaves.

target or a creature adjacent to the target.
Duergar Bombardier
Alchemy intrigues many duergars, and their cruel traditions often
motivate them to experiment on slaves. Eager to inﬂict pain
and justify the abuse as a method of expanding knowledge,
duergar bombardiers often accompany slaver bands so they can have the ﬁrst
chance to select their next test subjects from captured victims. To duergar
bombardiers, the lob of each bomb represents a new opportunity to observe
how their targets react and record the results to enhance future modiﬁcations
to their alchemical concoctions.

Dullahan
Riding on a horse as black as night, the headless hunter known as the dullahan
tracks down and takes the heads of those it deems unﬁt to continue living. When
closing in for the kill, the dullahan ﬁrst whispers its victim’s name, then swiftly
collects its prize, casting a pall of dread upon all who witness the grim execution.
A dullahan manifests when a particularly violent warrior is beheaded and
the warrior’s soul stubbornly clings to material existence (or is refused entry
to the afterlife). Most dullahans return to their former homelands, where
they can exact vengeance those they feel wronged them in life (or their living
descendants). A dullahan’s concept of justice is swift and merciless, and once it
has selected a target, it is unwavering in its cause.
Perhaps even more than revenge on the living, a dullahan desires its own rotted
head. An individual who wields the head of a dullahan is powerful indeed, for a
dullahan will grudgingly serve such a master in the hopes of reclaiming its missing
skull. Mighty ﬁends such as devils command dullahans to harvest souls or lead
armies for them, while a mortal might use such an undead warrior to fulﬁll a
personal vendetta. No matter its master’s rank or station, however, a dullahan won’t
hesitate to kill its liege and reclaim its head when the opportunity presents itself.
Most dullahan lairs are abandoned, overgrown ruins or other dilapidated
places where severed heads and other trophies line the walls. Some dullahans,
on the other hand, are content to simply commit their foul deeds and leave the
remains of their decapitated victims in the streets, strewn among a copse of dead
trees, or unceremoniously tossed in a bog hole.

whisper of dullahans who hunt
down their victims using packs of
hellish ebony hounds. And along

pirates and merchants alike insist
of the existence of a black-sailed
ship crewed entirely by headless
undead sailors.

ALLIES IN THE SKIES
Aeries of giant eagles can make
potent allies to those who respect
their territories and approach
without malice in their hearts.
Giant eagles are just as likely to
swoop in and provide unsolicited
aid to those in the lowlands
of their realm against obvious
dangers, but if not oﬀered respect
in turn, giant eagles may abandon
an unpleasant victim to its fate
rather than suﬀer more insults.
Eagle
Few avian creatures can match the beauty and grace of the eagle.
Eagle
These large birds of prey swoop down from incredible heights to snatch ﬁsh and
small mammals in their powerful talons. Eagles nest atop high trees or steep cliffs
that provide a commanding view of the surrounding area. They avoid nesting too
near civilization, but some remote cultures train eagles as hunting companions.

Giant Eagle
No mere animals, giant eagles have a keen intellect and a strong sense of
honor. As guardians of their mountain homes, giant eagles attempt to prevent
the encroachment of civilization upon wild land and the predations of wicked
humanoid settlements. Unlike ordinary eagles, which tend to be solitary creatures,
giant eagles congregate within aeries holding up to a dozen members and work
together to protect their domains.
Giant eagles have wingspans up to 30 feet across and weigh up to 500 pounds.
These impressive birds cannot be easily broken or cowed. A giant eagle may allow
trusted terrestrial friends to ride it, but they invariably resist saddles, harnesses, or
other equipment that might suggest they are mere
beasts of burden rather than trusted companions.
Giant eagles are long-lived and take debts and
oaths very seriously, often remembering slights for
years and remaining slow to forgive.

# DRIDER
================================================================================


OTHER FLESHWARPS
Grothluts may be the weakest
example of a ﬂeshwarp, and
driders the most successful, but
others exist as well. Ghonhatines
are lumbering ﬂeshwarps formed
from xulgaths, while the tentacled
irnakurses are formed from surfacedwelling elves. Sinspawn (pages
296–297) are ﬂeshwarps as well, of
course, although their methods of
creation diﬀer drastically from the
techniques mastered by drow.
Drider
The ﬁrst ﬂeshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their most
successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that
of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic ﬂeshwarp—the only ﬂeshwarp
known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos
of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders
have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form
with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reﬂection on the
matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.
Although the ﬂeshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment
for drow who fell from grace, the signiﬁcant powers and strengths gained from the
horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of
lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure.
In return for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian,
soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead
their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city’s periphery. The painful truth is
that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow
have a penchant for working their ﬂeshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in
deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.
Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well
known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider’s innate spells
remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different
types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared
than the drider presented below.

FLYTRAP TREASURE
Giant ﬂytraps have enough
instinctual intellect to eﬀectively
ambush prey or to move about to
seek out better hunting grounds,
but they don’t value treasure. Still,
a ﬂytrap tends to accumulate a
small wealth of discarded loot
from those it has eaten, discarding
these shiny baubles in the
periphery of its root system once it
has ﬁnished digesting its meal.
Flytrap
Flytraps are dangerous creatures as eager to feed on humanoids and larger prey
as they are monstrous insects.
Snapping Flytrap
The snapping ﬂytrap is a ravenous, carnivorous plant that is quick to bite at any
creature that passes by. Snapping ﬂytraps typically have two sets of tooth-edged
leaves, each measuring 3 feet wide, at the end of 10-foot-long stalks.

UNIQUE LICHDOM
The exact ritual, ingredients
for deadly concoctions, and
magical conditions required to
become a lich are unique and
diﬀerent for every living creature.
Understanding a spellcaster’s path
to lichdom can help, but is no
guarantee of success for others.
LICH PHYLACTERY
ITEM 12
RARE
ARCANE
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Price 1,600 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
This item is crafted by a spellcaster who wishes to become a lich. When a lich is
destroyed, its soul ﬂees to the phylactery. The phylactery then rebuilds the lich’s undead
body over the course of 1d10 days. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the phylactery,
fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body).
A lich’s phylactery must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning.
The standard phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment inscribed
with magical phrases. This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more
durable or diﬃcult-to-obtain phylacteries. A phylactery might also come in the form of a
ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the speciﬁcs are up to the creator.
Demilich
Demiliches are formed when a lich, through carelessness or by accident, loses its
phylactery. As years pass, the lich’s body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull
as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left
wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses
the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form.
Negative energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and
teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull,
embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic,
forms a creature called a demilich.
Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time
to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich’s
hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power
in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich’s
skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some
theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the
demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is ﬁnally free to wander the
planes and ﬁnd new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the
Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear
in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.

concealed. Any creature other than the demilich that enters or begins its turn in
the aura takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage.

companions for a lich or demilich.

demilich. Eﬀect The demilich ends torpor, rolls initiative, and gains the eﬀect of its
contingency’s companion spell. The contingency resets after 24 hours.
Countermeasures Ȳ˓ Trigger The demilich’s turn begins. Eﬀect The demilich casts blink,
ﬂy, spell turning, or true seeing on itself. It usually chooses spell turning unless it
already has that spell in eﬀect.

Demilich Eye Gems (arcane) A demilich has gemstone eyes that glow when the demilich
is active. Each eye contains an 8th-level spell that targets one creature (usually one
eye has maze and the other polar ray). The demilich can Activate an eye. This uses
the number of spellcasting actions the spell requires, and also requires command and
envision components. When the demilich casts a spell from a gemstone eye, that
eye stops glowing for 1d4 rounds, during which time that eye’s spell can’t be used.
Occasionally, one or both of the two demilich eye gems can be harvested from a
destroyed demilich as magic items (see below).
Devour Soul Ȱɵ (arcane, necromancy, negative) Requirements A soul has been trapped
in one of the demilich’s blight quartz gems (see Trap Soul) for 24 hours. Eﬀect The
demilich consumes the soul. The soul is utterly destroyed, and the demilich regains
HP equal to double the creature’s level.
Mental Magic A demilich can replace all material and somatic components for casting
spells with verbal components, and can replace all Interact components for activating
magic items with envision components.
Staﬀ Gems A demilich long ago absorbed the spells from a staﬀ into gemstone nodules
embedded in its skull, with larger nodules representing higher-level spells. It can cast
any of the spells as though it were Activating the staﬀ, and regains 1 charge per
4 hours spent in torpor, to a maximum of 8 charges. A typical demilich has the
spells from a greater staﬀ of necromancy, but it could have spells from
another staﬀ of 8th level or lower instead.
Trap Soul Ȱɵ command Frequency once per day per gem; Eﬀect Ten
blight quartz gemstones on the demilich’s skull can trap the
souls of the living. The Activated gem casts bind soul. This bind
soul can target and aﬀect a dying creature instead of a corpse.
The dying creature can attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save; if
it succeeds, it doesn’t die and its soul is not trapped but it’s
enervated 2 (or is unaﬀected entirely on a critical success).
When the soul of a creature gets trapped, the creature’s body
swiftly turns to dust.
The gemstones work like the black sapphires used in
bind soul, except that they can hold creatures of up to
17th level and have a value of 200 gp apiece. The demilich
can Devour a Soul it has trapped.

MEDUSA INFILTRATORS
Rumors persist of disguised
medusas acting as prominent
members of criminal organizations
such as the Sczarni in Riddleport and
the Aspis Consortium in Port Peril,
and their kind is known to thrive
in metropolises including Absalom
and Katapesh. Because they are so
widespread, medusas resembling
humans of every major ethnicity can
be found in Avistan and Garund.
Medusa
Monstrous humanoids that resemble humans with snakes instead of hair,
medusas are best known for their petrifying gazes that—if lingered upon—can
permanently transform mortals to stone. Medusas are shrewd and manipulative
adversaries who collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to
exploit the fears of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic
items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden
power, or inﬁltrate a society to beguile inﬂuential politicians. Their ability to
worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of
criminal outﬁts and thieves’ guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena
leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers ﬁnd what
they seek—for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufﬁcient, a
medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little
more than a glare.
Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from
a conﬂict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves
readied to resist the effects of a medusa’s gaze have nevertheless fallen to a
medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their
foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may
barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried
by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the
monster’s life.

# DARK NAGA
================================================================================


Bestiary
NAGAS AND OTHERS
Dark nagas might rule over goblins
(page 180), orcs (page 256),
xulgaths (page 336), or decadent
folk, especially corrupt aristocrats.
Guardian nagas might be found
with other goodly creatures of any
sort, from fey in natural sites to
constructs in ancient vaults.
Naga
Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable
intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble
those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all
but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward
away foes, little is understood of the naga’s unsettling physiology.
Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the
accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire
nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society—an entire empire
ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers
with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.
Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering
them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins.
In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually
unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be
worshipped as gods.
Dark Naga
Dark nagas are wicked, jealous creatures that crave power and wealth. Indeed,
the dark naga sees such ideals as spiritual expressions of an essential truth: if
one can take something, that something is theirs to have. The dark naga sees
other creatures as lessers worthy only of subjugation or as rivals who must
be eliminated.
Dark nagas dwell in remote places other creatures have forsaken,
searching abandoned ruins for wealth and potent magic items. Those
unlucky trespassers into a dark naga’s lair typically ﬁnd themselves as
the naga’s slaves or playthings, put to sleep with the monster’s poison or
incinerated by its deadly magic. Some dark nagas are more disposed
toward socializing than others; in these cases, they may become
wicked despots who rule over enclaves of captive or unsuspecting
subjects. Subtler dark nagas, especially those who crave ﬁner
luxuries, dwell in or under the wealthy settlements and use their
wiles to garner a decadent following, forming something
akin to a cult with the naga as the jewelry-bedecked object
of worship.

Stage 2 slowed 2 (1 round); Stage 3 unconscious with no Perception check to

Guardian Naga
The opposite of dark nagas in many ways, guardian nagas are benevolent and
wise protectors of places of great natural or supernatural signiﬁcance: ancient
oak groves, forgotten holy temples, and vaults of sacred power are just a few
examples of locations that these nagas protect. Guardian nagas believe that the
beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to
such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with
similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors
and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.
Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood,
to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to
protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place,
passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent
nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become
the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the
site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.
It is difﬁcult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of
evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately
for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see
encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and
expand worldviews.

Dryad
Dryads are fey guardians of the trees and creatures who dwell in wooded areas.
They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their sacred
groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to enlist
the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone. In times
of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at
harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.
Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied
to a speciﬁc tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree
are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to
match their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink
coloration and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.

NYMPH LOCATIONS
Nymphs tend to be closely
associated with speciﬁc areas of
natural splendor and beauty—
woodlands for dryads, rivers for
naiads. Areas where nymphs
dwell always look more pristine,
breathtaking, and scenic than they
would otherwise.

Tree Dependent A dryad is mystically bonded to a single great tree and must remain
within 300 feet of it. If she moves beyond that range, she becomes sickened 1 and is
unable to recover. She must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save every hour or increase
the sickened value by 1 (to a maximum of sickened 4). After 24 hours, she becomes
drained 1, with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours. A dryad can
perform a 24-hour ritual to bond herself to a new tree.

Tree Meld ʚʖ (primal, transmutation) The dryad touches a tree of
enough volume to contain her and merges into it for as long as she
wishes. She can Cast a Spell while inside as long as the spell doesn’t
require a line of eﬀect outside the tree. She can hear, but not
see, what’s going on outside the tree. She can
Dismiss this eﬀect.
Signiﬁcant physical damage dealt to the
tree expels the dryad from the tree and deals
3d6 damage to her. Passwall expels the dryad
without dealing damage.
If a dryad uses this ability on her bonded tree, she instead enters an
extradimensional living space within the tree; Tree Meld gains the
extradimensional trait. A dryad can bring up to two other creatures
with her when entering her home within her bonded tree. The dryad
can still be expelled from this space as above.
Nymph Queens
Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of
untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of
nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and
more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad
queens as simply “nymphs.”
Nymph Queen Abilities
A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same
type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph
queen’s ward is a signiﬁcant region, and she strengthens and viviﬁes this territory
with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the
corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain
the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the
nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based
on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow
a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to
change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Nymph queens can transform
between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and
any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking
version of their natural form.

OTHER NYMPHS
Naiads and dryads are the most wellknown nymphs, but others exist as
well. Hesperides, for example, are
wards of the sunset and golden light
and can be encountered dwelling on
coastal cliﬀsides or remote islands.
Lampads, on the other hand, are
dark, moody nymphs found in
wondrous,
crystal-lined
caverns
deep underground.
Focus Beauty Ȱɵ (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen
focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a
Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty
aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in
the nymph queen’s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature
only once per turn.
Inspiration ̂ˬ (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A nymph queen can inspire a
single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock
of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing
with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks,
Performance checks, and Will saves.
If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s
muse, the bard gains an additional beneﬁt depending on their muse theme: for lore muse,
the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status
bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the eﬀects
of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill
checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.
Nymph’s Beauty (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures
that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suﬀer an eﬀect
described in the nymph queen’s entry.
Tied to the Land A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a speciﬁc region, such as a forest
for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally
resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and
rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a
counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph
queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region
eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph
queen swiftly heals the entire region.
Naiad Queen
Naiad queens rule over pristine wildernesses centered on untouched lakes or other
bodies of fresh water. Bards’ songs and artists’ paintings of nymphs tend to depict
naiad queens in their slightly more humanoid forms, which they don when they
make the rare journey into civilized lands to garner allies or gauge threats.
Most naiad queens treat those who respect their domains with kindness, but
they are ﬁerce and quick in eliminating foes. Their blinding beauty and breadth of
offensive spells make naiad queens ﬁerce opponents if forced into a ﬁght.

hamadryad representing nature’s wonders and the other
fey representing nature’s wrath.

GIANT OCTOPUS LAIRS
Giant octopuses favor shipwrecks,
coral reefs, or underwater caverns
as lairs, where they can take
advantage of narrow conﬁnes
for protection. Giant octopuses,
like their smaller kin, are fond
of adorning and decorating their
lairs with found objects—many of
which, in the giant octopus’s case,
are also magical weapons, shields,

sunken ships or fallen adventurers.

RAKSHASA IMMORTALS
Above all rakshasas rule the
rakshasa immortals, powerful
unique entities who deem
themselves deities. These beings
include Aksha of the Second
Breath, Bundha the Singing
Butcher, Dradjit the Godslayer,
Kunkarna the Dream Warrior,
Mursha the Beastmaster,
Otikaya the Spirit Archer,
Surpa the Avenger,
Zabha the Desecrator,
and untold others.
Rakshasa
Rakshasas are evil spirits that cloak themselves in the guises of humanoid
creatures, that they might walk unseen among their prey. They embody what
is taboo among most societies, and in the shape of those they seek to deﬁle,
rakshasas gorge themselves on these hideous acts. A wide range of rakshasas
exist; presented below are the diminutive, sinister dandasuka rakshasa and the
infamous raja rakshasa, who are the most widespread and commonly encountered
of these ﬁends.
Dandasuka
Known as “biters” among the more powerful rakshasa castes, dandasukas serve
as spies and assassins for rakshasa clans or powerful spellcasters who have
found methods to bind one of these ﬁends to their will. Born to manipulate and
murder, these half-sized terrors revel in their work and delight in the sight of
blood. They often dress in extravagant clothes dyed with ostentatious colors
and wear numerous elaborate accessories, whether in their true form or in
disguise as human children, halﬂing merchants, or anything else that helps them
blend into their targeted society.
A dandasuka rakshasa is constantly haunted by a monstrous hunger that
gnaws at its hyperactive body, forcing it to feed often. In combat, a dandasuka
might pause to lick a bloody blade or lap at a pool of spilled blood on the ﬂoor.
These creatures settle for other meat when they must, but much prefer the taste
of mortal humanoid ﬂesh. Regular offers of such victuals can keep a dandasuka
loyal to anyone willing to provide frequent meals, but care must be taken in
keeping a dandasuka, for many stories tell of them being overly eager to serve
an adored benefactor, taking off-hand remarks too literally, and
performing services of violence that were never intended.

RAJA HEADS
Raja's heads often resemble those
of cats or snakes, but they can
also be similar to apes, jackals,
vultures, elephants, mantises,
lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are
possible. In most cases, the type
of head a raja rakshasa possesses
symbolizes its personality—a
tiger-headed one is stealthy and
ravenous, while a boar-headed one
might be gluttonous and crude.
Raja Rakshasa
When not disguised as a humanoid, the raja rakshasa has the head of an animal.
The hands of a raja rakshasa are more subtly unsettling, for the ﬁngers of these
ﬁends bend outward, away from the palms.
More than any other types of rakshasa, rajas scoff at religion. They understand
the power of the divine, yet they view themselves as the only things worthy
of worship from mortal creatures; not even their own immortals are deemed
deserving of such gloriﬁcation. Raja rakshasas often form close-knit families that
work together to bring down mortal cities or to rule them from the shadows
within. Such families of rakshasas often incorporate other breeds of the ﬁend,
often using dandasukas as favored servants or stealthy spies. Even though a raja
family works together to achieve a shared goal, inﬁghting and treachery among
their own is a constant threat.

DREAD WRAITHS
Dread wraiths are much more
powerful variants of the standard
wraith. A dread wraith is a
9th‑level creature that can drain
the life from creatures via its
mere presence. Often, a dread
wraith commands a small group
of normal wraiths, and in life may
have been a bloodthirsty warlord
or brutal general.
Wraith
Wraiths are malevolent undead who drain life and shun light. Their shadowy,
incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reﬂect their hatred for the
living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their
enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are
the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up
their wicked ways. Further complicating the matter is the fact that wraiths multiply
by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind—meaning a
handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness.
Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt
any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight
conﬁnes them to the shadowy places of the world—places where they can blend
in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulﬁng their prey.
Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death
and mayhem are commonplace—countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan
underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of ﬁendish cultic rituals. In these
places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins,
sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as
the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough
to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous
caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas.
As they’re formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths
pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead,
wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They’re among the ruling class in
Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards
and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of
the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs,
typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.
