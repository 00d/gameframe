# DAEODON
================================================================================

Boar Charge ʚʖ The boar Strides twice and then makes a tusk Strike. As long as it
moved at least 20 feet, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack roll.
Daeodon
Where the typical boar is merely ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the
towering daeodon is legitimately hateful and ruthlessly violent. Although
omnivorous, the daeodon (known in some regions simply as a giant boar)
prefers to feed on ﬂesh. Primarily a scavenger, the daeodon isn’t adverse
to attacking creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or
to protect any perceived encroachment into its lair or feeding grounds.
Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as
mounts or war-trained battle beasts; orc cavalry mounted on
daeodons is a fearsome force indeed.
A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet tall at
the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.

Daeodon Charge ʚʖ The daeodon Strides twice and then makes a tusk Strike. As
long as it moved at least 20 feet, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack roll.
A Medium or smaller creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 19 Reﬂex
save or be knocked prone by the force of the blow.
BOAR LOCATIONS
Boars can be found in almost
any environment, from forests to
deserts, warm or cold, including
even high-altitude mountainous
regions. They tend to prefer
forests, marshes, and meadows.
Daeodons are likewise found
in such regions but generally
prefer remote reaches far from
civilization.

BOGGARD VILLAGES
Boggards prefer to dwell in
swamplands and mires. Though
they are at home in the water, they
prefer to spend most of their lives
on land, and build villages of mud
huts. They often keep guardian
beasts, such as bloodseekers
(page 42), crocodiles (page 67),
giant frogs, or other feral animals
tamed (if only just barely) to serve
as protectors.
Boggard
Boggards are aggressive humanoid amphibians that thrive in swamps, marshes,
and even some rain forests. Boggards hatch from eggs into tadpoles, ﬁercely
competing for food and even consuming their siblings in that struggle. Over 3
years, the surviving boggards develops arms, legs, and lungs while learning the
rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfare—everything needed to survive in their
might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking
swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic.
Boggard Scout
Often tasked with patrolling the borders of their lands, boggard scouts learn to
speak another language (typically Common) to make it easier to issue threats and
insults toward trespassers.

Swamp Stride A boggard scout ignores diﬃcult terrain caused by swamp terrain features.
Terrifying Croak Ȱɵ (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The boggard scout unleashes a
terrifying croak. Any non-boggard within 30 feet becomes frightened 1 unless they
succeed at a DC 17 Will save; those who critically succeed are temporarily immune for
1 minute.
Tongue Grab If the boggard scout hits a creature with its tongue, that creature becomes
grabbed by the boggard. Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn’t immobilized, but
it can’t move beyond the reach of the boggard’s tongue. A creature can sever the
tongue by hitting AC 13 and dealing at least 2 slashing damage. Though this doesn’t
deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it
regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
Boggard Warrior
Boggard warriors exalt in single combat, and prefer to ﬁght alone so that
none can contest their kills. They have been known to pursue enemies who ﬂee
combat with a single-mindedness that seems almost supernatural.

LOST CIVILIZATIONS
Cyclopes dwell in or near the
remains of their lost civilizations—
notably Ghol-Gan in Garund,
Koloran in northwestern
Casmaron, and various kingdoms
in Iblydos. Ruins of Ghol-Gan
still dot the archipelago of the
Shackles, and untold numbers
of treasures belonging to the
ancient cyclops empire still await
discovery. Pirates and treasure
hunters regularly conduct
expeditions in search of lost Ghol-
Gani relics, but many of these
voyages never return. Among
those that do, survivors speak of
terrible curses, gruesome traps,
and one-eyed undead guardians.
Cyclops
The cyclopes are violent giants with a tragic past. Although they possess only
one eye, they could once see far more than most, possessing occult wisdom and
divinatory magic that gave them the mystic ability of foresight. But their legendary
oracular powers failed to prevent the fall of their society, and the vast kingdoms
of the cyclops long ago collapsed into ruin. Today, cyclopes have forgotten much
of what they once knew, and they skulk among the crumbling remains of their
fallen cities like forgotten kings and queens gone mad.
Cyclops
The kingdoms of the cyclopes date to an age before the rise of humanity,
when dragons and giants and serpentfolk ruled the world. The cyclopes built
enormous stone cities and prayed to ancient gods of brutality and wrath, but
their power to foresee the future failed them, and their civilization collapsed.
Today, most cyclopes have virtually no knowledge of the former glory of their
kind, even though it is not uncommon for
them to dwell among the ruins of their
greatness. Cyclops cities include monuments
and imposing murals which depict their
peoples’ history, but few now among them can
read or interpret these relics of the past.
In addition to their single eye, cyclopes are
also famous for their never-ending hunger, an
appetite so all-consuming that some scholars
theorize it may in fact be some kind of
curse. The ever-present hunger of the
cyclopes seems to have some connection
to the death of their civilization—though
whether this voracity was the cause or a
side-effect of their people’s downfall is likely
destined to remain a mystery.
Although details of the cyclopes’ gods have
largely been lost to the annals of time, what
little is known about these deities suggests they
were vindictive and petty enough to curse their
own people if they felt neglected or badly served.

DEMONIC DEITIES
The most powerful demons are
known as demon lords (the term
is gender neutral in this case).
Of these divinities, Lamashtu is
the most powerful. Countless
other demon lords exist, including
Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri,
and Zura.
Demon
When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a
deadly ﬁend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic
sins like wrath or gluttony, or more “specialized” depravities like an obsession
with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon’s driving
goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal
souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-
ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Abyss.
Quasit
Unlike other demons, quasits are formed when a mortal spellcaster sheds a portion
of their own sinful soul to create a familiar or companion. When these quasits outlive
their creators, they become free willed and seek methods of returning to the Abyss,
a task that requires pledging servitude to more powerful demons, so many quasits
instead opt to remain on the Material Plane to promote evil and hope for chance and
luck to someday provide them with a method of reaching the Abyss on their own.

CYTILLESH
Deros grow and ingest a poisonous
fungus called cytillesh, also known
as brain mold. Cytillesh gives oﬀ
a pale blue glow and can cause
birth defects and various adverse
eﬀects. Deros aren’t fazed by these
detriments, as prolonged exposure
can also slow the eﬀects of aging
and, in rare cases, provide occult
powers to certain individuals
known as “magisters.” Deros can
also brew cytillesh spores into a
poison that creates delusions and
hallucinations.

Aklyses
The aklys is a throwing club with a hook on one end and a lengthy cord attached
to the other. It is an uncommon advanced melee weapon in the club group. It deals
1d6 bludgeoning damage and has 1 Bulk. It requires one hand to use and has the
ranged trip, tethered, thrown 20 feet, and trip weapon traits; the new traits are
described below. Though aklyses aren’t available in most shops, one might be
purchased for 5 gp from a vendor that specializes in strange weapons.
Ranged Trip: This weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill at a distance
up to the weapon’s ﬁrst range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance
penalty. You can add the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the
check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn’t deal any damage
when used to Trip. This trait usually only appears on a thrown weapon.
Tethered: This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you
to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand while wielding
this weapon, you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your
grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed
(unless it is being held by another creature).

Devil
Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal
life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout
all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted
by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered
pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who
succumb to these temptations ﬁnd themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless
torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of
being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a speciﬁc
role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell,
from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly
lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized
devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit ﬁends command
entire infernal armies.
Lemure
These shapeless masses of quivering ﬂesh are the least of devilkind. Pathetic creatures
from Hell’s ﬁrst layer, lemures roam alongside damned and suffering souls. Pit
ﬁends can combine the essence of a mob of lemures to concentrate their collective
wickedness with a single form, granting it an infernal sentience and transforming it
into a more powerful devil (see the pit ﬁend’s Devil Shaping ability).

lemure devil can issue a command
to all lemures within 60 feet of it
with a single action, which has the
auditory and concentrate traits. The devil
picks one of the following orders lemures can understand, and the
lemures follow that order. The command and its eﬀects end once
the commander is out of the lemure’s sight, a new command is
issued by the same or another devil, or the lemure dies.
•
Kill The lemure attacks one target the commander
singles out and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack
rolls against the target.
•
Defend The lemure circles the commander and
attacks any creature that comes near. It gains a +1
circumstance bonus to AC and saves.
•	 Fetch The lemure gains a +10–foot circumstance
bonus to its Speed and attempts to get an object
or person the commander singles out. It attacks
anyone and anything that gets in the way.
•
Work The lemure performs drudge work
dictated by the commander.
DIABOLIC DIVINITIES
Many unique and powerful devils
hold positions of power in Hell.
The most numerous of these are
the infernal dukes, many of whom
were promoted to this position
from already impressive statures
as pit ﬁends. The supreme ruler of
Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince
of Darkness. Between these two
tiers rule the eight archdevils—see
the sidebar on the facing page.

DHAMPIR LOCATIONS
Most dhampirs make their homes
in urban areas, though some more
reclusive individuals claim ruins or
dungeons as their domains.
Dhampir
As the mortal offspring of a vampire and a living parent, dhampirs occupy an
unusual place among the living. Their vampiric parentage lends them elongated
incisors, an unearthly beauty and physical grace, a ghostly pallor, and a piercing
gaze. Perhaps their most distinctive feature, however, is their connection to
negative energy, which heals them, leaving them as vulnerable to positive energy
as any undead creature. Though they don’t suffer the full range of a vampire’s
vulnerabilities, they do share certain characteristics with their vampire parent,
leading to several distinct dhampir heritages across Golarion. By far the most
common dhampirs are svetocher, the children of the more common moroi vampires.
Many dhampirs lived their childhoods as orphans, often because their mortal
parents believed their child to be cursed and abandoned them, or perished
as a result of a difﬁcult childbirth. Often outcast, some dhampirs leverage
their charisma and personal magnetism to manipulate those around them,
while others struggle to form relationships. Frequent mistrust of a dhampir’s
parentage present further challenges when dhampirs attempt to integrate into
mortal society. Those who seek out their vampiric parent instead often ﬁnd
themselves considered inferior, rejected as they were with regular mortals
but for different reasons. But in regions like Nidal, Geb, and Ustalav, where
vampires themselves carry some degree of respect, dhampirs can sometimes ﬁnd
their heritage empowering.
Dhampirs ﬁll countless roles within many communities. Some prefer to blend in
as best they can, holding regular jobs and building families (most children born
to dhampirs share an ancestry with the dhampir’s mortal parent, but a rare few
are born as dhampirs themselves). Those who learn to make the most of their
inherited charm can achieve a high societal status, whether leveraging traditional
avenues of power or gathering followers enamored by the dhampir’s abilities.
With a lifespan rivaling that of an elf, a dhampir can develop extensive
inﬂuence and engage in long-reaching schemes of massive scope. Further, their
ancestry lends them a proclivity to necromancy and the occult arts.

DINOSAURS IN FANTASY
At ﬁrst glance, the inclusion of
dinosaurs in a fantasy setting
might seem strange, but dinosaurs
are an excellent creature to use
in a game that bridges the gap
between familiar real-world
animals and legendary monsters.
If having dinosaurs mix freely with
lions, manticores, and dragons still
seems strange to you, consider
having them dwell in remote,
primeval lands, as suggested in
the sidebars on pages 99–100.
On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in
the wilder regions of the world,
particularly on the continent of
Garund, though they are common
enough that PCs might ﬁnd some
on display in a menagerie in a
northern city, in use as guardian
creatures, or even kept by druids
as loyal animal companions.
Dinosaur
Remnants from the world’s primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still
exist in large numbers in isolated and remote wildernesses or far underground
within magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous
humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals.
Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it
to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such
activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and
other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take
them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond
their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping
into the wild.
Velociraptor
A smaller cousin of the deinonychus, the velociraptor is a swift, cunning
pack hunter. It has no fear of larger creatures, and a group of these dinosaurs
won’t hesitate to attack creatures the size of a horse. Velociraptors are social
animals, and tend to live in groups of up to a dozen other velociraptors. They
have manes of feathery plumage that extend down their backs and along the
sides of their arms, legs, and tail, while their underbellies and ﬂanks are scaly.
These feathers allow them to blend into their natural terrains with ease, but
when excited, attempting to intimidate, or seeking a mate, a velociraptor can
puff and frill this plumage to expose much brighter colors normally covered
by the longer feathers. A typical velociraptor is 1-1/2
feet tall, 7 feet long, and weighs 35 pounds.

Pack Attack The velociraptor deals 1d4 extra damage
to any creature that’s within reach of at least two of the
velociraptor’s allies.
Deinonychus
Deinonychuses are wily hunters that attack in groups of up to a dozen
individuals, ripping apart their prey with sharp talons and powerful jaws. They
are lean and muscular, and have two powerful legs and a long tail that helps
them maintain balance. Although deinonychuses don’t use their dexterous
clawed forelimbs to attack, the dinosaurs can use them to pull aside
small barriers. Although some of these dinosaurs have scaly skin, most
have thatches of vibrantly colored feathers as well. A deinonychus is
about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.
However, larger deinonychuses exist. These creatures—which stand
taller than a human—are called megaraptors.

Dragon, Chromatic
While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the
strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly
feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each
color of dragon unleashes its own ﬂavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw,
tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful
as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary.
Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved
and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.
Shape-Changing Dragons
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to inﬁltrate settlements or
inﬂuence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape Ȱɵ (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on
the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or
attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its
Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Chromatic Dragon Spellcasters
Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that
type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy
and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You
can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the
same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s
Intelligence or Charisma modiﬁer by 1 or 2 to reﬂect its mastery of magic.
Chromatic Dragons of Golarion
The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and
sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are
no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share
their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen
of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that
they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich
mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic
and metallic dragons.
Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the
wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the
sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of
the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly
in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a
wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the
Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea
region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range
in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they
threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.
Black Dragon
Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their
domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities
from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-
quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their
breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except
perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.
Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow
them to breathe water. Their frills and ﬁns make them accomplished swimmers, well
suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the
fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.

SERZILIAN
The great wyrm black dragon

She knows something darker even
than herself resides somewhere in
the swamp, but she has yet to ﬁnd
how to summon such an entity. For
now, she slumbers, waking only to
demand sacriﬁces.
Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The ﬂoors are littered with rotting
meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid
twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes,
and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do
with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure
hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer
substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.

DRAKAUTHIX SPORELINGS
When a new drakauthix bursts
forth from a spore-infested corpse,
it has no true way of defending
itself. However, a sporeling does
not need to hunt until it grows
much larger. Each sporeling
harvests enough material from
the body it emerged from to grow
to its full size over a few short
days. After it has done so, the
drakauthix detaches from the cave
ceiling and, starving, immediately
seeks out its ﬁrst meal in the
cavern below.
Drakauthix
The drakauthix is a massive fungus that ﬂoats through the heights of the largest
Darklands caverns, propelled by bladders that spray air and spores. A voracious
but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures
from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed.
The drakauthix’s digestive process is entirely external—it clings to victims,
and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the ﬂesh before
the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground
below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called
sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling
and grow.
The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals,
and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing
on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems
it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix
drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal.
The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a
grudge and simply slithers off to ﬁnd a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest
the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn’t above feasting on more active
prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for
danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.
Some Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for
their ﬂesh, which has a unique ﬂavor with a peppery aftertaste. Subterranean
races also make ink from drakauthixes by burning their carcasses, then grinding
and pressing the ashes for a long time until a silvery substance congeals.

DRAKE ECOLOGY
Drakes reach maturity and
reproduce much earlier than
dragons, meaning that they are a
far more common threat than their
more powerful forebears. Drakes
have few qualms about dwelling
with one another (provided they
are the same species), often
establishing dens in pockets of
wilderness suitable to their needs,
such as swampy grottoes, shallow
shoreline caves, or cliﬀside perches.
Drake
Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct—drakes are primitive draconic monsters
who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of their larger cousins but little (if any)
of the cunning. While they’re weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than
dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around
them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups ﬁttingly
called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of
river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of
desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.
Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one
species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes
lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails
with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid
close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in
wide swaths from comfortable distances while ﬂying overhead. Finally, all drakes
have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to
perform incredible feats of speed.
Drake Eggs
While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized
creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components
in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for
drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.
A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3
to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to
their natural environment, perhaps the most difﬁcult aspect of drake husbandry.
While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle
drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes
(which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of ﬂame and frost
drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difﬁcult
to replicate safely.
A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The
coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly
from one species to the next. A creature
must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check,
or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to
identify the drake species of a
speciﬁc egg.
Once
a
drake
hatches, it imprints
on the ﬁrst creature
that it sees. A creature imprinted on in
this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature
checks to train or command that
drake. The market price of a drake
egg varies depending on the region, the type
of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has
in mind, but typically depends on the level of
the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous,
and intelligent creatures, many societies do not
condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize
those who engage in it.
It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full
size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount
or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers
are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconﬁdence,
or general lack of skill.

DRAKE TREASURE
Drakes share dragon’s interest
in treasure, but lack dragons’
discerning taste. A drake hoard
will certainly contain coins,
jewelry, gemstones, gear, and
even the odd magic item or
two, but the bulk of the hoard
invariably consists of broken
weapons, shiny rocks, bits of
junk, and other doubtful
pieces of refuse.
River Drake
Although the glistening scales and sleek, ﬁn-like wings on these drakes give them
an appearance reminiscent of river ﬁsh, they are actually distant relatives of the
black dragon. While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable
of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water’s
surface. This ﬂexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from ﬁsh and
boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.

Drow
The ﬁrst drow were elves who ﬂed into the depths of the world from a devastating
cataclysm thousands of years ago. In their journey below, they fell to bickering
and in-ﬁghting, drawing the attention of sinister intelligences beyond their own.
Whether it was the inﬂuence of a speciﬁc demon lord, the Rough Beast Rovagug,
or some other fell force is unknown, but in that time the elves transformed both
spiritually and physically, tainting their hearts with desires for cruelty, sadism,
and violence. The hues of their eyes became sinister red or bleached white, and
their ﬂesh adopted an unearthly lavender sheen that made the drow instantly
recognizable. The drow also developed potent magical abilities and resistances
that further empowered them, if at the cost of their souls.
Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently
dysfunctional society, inﬂuenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on
providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many
of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a speciﬁc
demon lord patron—but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to
bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn’t simply
consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one’s superior—be it a
teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships—is the real bond
holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest
drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike.
The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed
stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends
crafted to share around a campﬁre. Today, the existence of drow is an understood
truth, and while their presence in the dark caverns deep below is unsettling, they
seem content to leave the surface world alone for now.

BECOMING A DROW
Rarely, when a surface elf
commits an act of cruelty heinous
enough to draw the attention of a
demon lord, transformation into a
drow can happen spontaneously—
but these transformations are
rare enough to be legends in their
own right. No known instance of a
drow reverting to an elf has ever
been recorded.

DROW EXILES
While drow society is evil, not all
drow are bound to these norms.
Those who seek something
better in life are invariably exiles
and often flee to the surface to
escape their sinister kin. These
drow often live as hermits, or
they seek out societies where
others have yet to hear the
legends regarding their kind.

OCCULT TRADITIONS
Unlike classical dwarven
practitioners of magic, duergars
have embraced the practice of
occultism. All duergars have at
least a few innate occult spells,
primary among them being the
ability to magically increase their
size. This power not only aids
them in intimidating and bullying
their slaves, but also serves as
a potent combat option against
their many enemies.
Duergar
Deep beneath the surface, duergars stubbornly claim the ancestral subterranean
homelands of the dwarves as their own, having refused to venture to the
surface along with their modern dwarven cousins. An exiled dwarven deity
named Droskar offered duergars salvation from the horrors of the Darklands,
and in exchange duergars endlessly toil in his honor within their subterranean
empire. Notorious slavers, duergars regularly raid other Darklands settlements
as well as surface communities in constant search of living beings to task with
endless amounts of work in their harsh and exhausting settlements.
Duergars are gray-skinned creatures, often referred to as “ashen” by those
surface dwarves willing to speak of them. These subterranean dwarves have a
strong natural connection with cave-dwelling vermin, and it’s common to see
duergar caravans drawn by teams of immense beetles. Most duergars devote
themselves to the worship of Droskar, a taskmaster of a god who demands
back-breaking toil in addition to regular prayer. Duergar leadership often
consists of powerful divine servants of Droskar, along with incredibly stout
warriors whose martial prowess ensures they can overcome any direct threat
to their rule. Almost every aspect of duergar society is controlled by a strict
hierarchy of leadership, with taskmasters directing subordinates across all
walks of life.
Duergar Sharpshooter
Duergar sharpshooters serve both as ranged support for slaver parties and
as snipers posted on towers overlooking quarries and other areas where
enslaved workers toil away the hours. Duergar sharpshooters also specialize
in nonlethal methods of ranged combat—tactics they are often called upon to
use when quelling slave riots or capturing escaped slaves.

DC 16 Reﬂex save or be knocked prone and immobilized until it is freed with a
successful DC 15 check to Escape. This check can be attempted either by the
target or a creature adjacent to the target.
Duergar Bombardier
Alchemy intrigues many duergars, and their cruel traditions often
motivate them to experiment on slaves. Eager to inﬂict pain
and justify the abuse as a method of expanding knowledge,
duergar bombardiers often accompany slaver bands so they can have the ﬁrst
chance to select their next test subjects from captured victims. To duergar
bombardiers, the lob of each bomb represents a new opportunity to observe
how their targets react and record the results to enhance future modiﬁcations
to their alchemical concoctions.

DUERGAR COMMUNITIES
Duergar communities are found
deep underground in the ruins
of abandoned dwarven cities.
Generations of duergar occupation
have resulted in the loss of
dwarven history as the ashen
honor their taskmaster deity by
reworking traditional dwarven art
into topics that elevate the exiled
god. That duergars themselves
seem incapable of achieving
the heights of artistry mastered
by their dwarven ancestors is
both a source of frustration and
shame that only fosters greater
resentment of those who dwell on
the surface.

Duergar Taskmaster
Duergar priests of the taskmaster god Droskar often assume leadership roles
within their communities, advancing the goals of their deity through coercion
and displays of force. Often referred to as duergar taskmasters, these leaders
often issue commands to duergar subordinates and slaves in the same
breath, treating the two almost as if they were interchangeable. As a
result, duergar taskmasters are loathed by both slave and slaver alike.

Dullahan
Riding on a horse as black as night, the headless hunter known as the dullahan
tracks down and takes the heads of those it deems unﬁt to continue living. When
closing in for the kill, the dullahan ﬁrst whispers its victim’s name, then swiftly
collects its prize, casting a pall of dread upon all who witness the grim execution.
A dullahan manifests when a particularly violent warrior is beheaded and
the warrior’s soul stubbornly clings to material existence (or is refused entry
to the afterlife). Most dullahans return to their former homelands, where
they can exact vengeance those they feel wronged them in life (or their living
descendants). A dullahan’s concept of justice is swift and merciless, and once it
has selected a target, it is unwavering in its cause.
Perhaps even more than revenge on the living, a dullahan desires its own rotted
head. An individual who wields the head of a dullahan is powerful indeed, for a
dullahan will grudgingly serve such a master in the hopes of reclaiming its missing
skull. Mighty ﬁends such as devils command dullahans to harvest souls or lead
armies for them, while a mortal might use such an undead warrior to fulﬁll a
personal vendetta. No matter its master’s rank or station, however, a dullahan won’t
hesitate to kill its liege and reclaim its head when the opportunity presents itself.
Most dullahan lairs are abandoned, overgrown ruins or other dilapidated
places where severed heads and other trophies line the walls. Some dullahans,
on the other hand, are content to simply commit their foul deeds and leave the
remains of their decapitated victims in the streets, strewn among a copse of dead
trees, or unceremoniously tossed in a bog hole.

with elite adjustments (page 6) and the ﬁend trait. This steed remains until it is

DULLAHAN LEGENDS
In Ustalav, residents recite legends
of a cadre of dullahans who
drive the “Coach of the Silent,” a
macabre funeral carriage pulled
by a team of spectral horses. To
the west, among the Lands of the
Linnorm Kings, Ulfen warriors
whisper of dullahans who hunt
down their victims using packs of
hellish ebony hounds. And along
the western coasts of Garund,
pirates and merchants alike insist
of the existence of a black-sailed
ship crewed entirely by headless
undead sailors.

ALLIES IN THE SKIES
Aeries of giant eagles can make
potent allies to those who respect
their territories and approach
without malice in their hearts.
Giant eagles are just as likely to
swoop in and provide unsolicited
aid to those in the lowlands
of their realm against obvious
dangers, but if not oﬀered respect
in turn, giant eagles may abandon
an unpleasant victim to its fate
rather than suﬀer more insults.
Eagle
Few avian creatures can match the beauty and grace of the eagle.
Eagle
These large birds of prey swoop down from incredible heights to snatch ﬁsh and
small mammals in their powerful talons. Eagles nest atop high trees or steep cliffs
that provide a commanding view of the surrounding area. They avoid nesting too
near civilization, but some remote cultures train eagles as hunting companions.

Giant Eagle
No mere animals, giant eagles have a keen intellect and a strong sense of
honor. As guardians of their mountain homes, giant eagles attempt to prevent
the encroachment of civilization upon wild land and the predations of wicked
humanoid settlements. Unlike ordinary eagles, which tend to be solitary creatures,
giant eagles congregate within aeries holding up to a dozen members and work
together to protect their domains.
Giant eagles have wingspans up to 30 feet across and weigh up to 500 pounds.
These impressive birds cannot be easily broken or cowed. A giant eagle may allow
trusted terrestrial friends to ride it, but they invariably resist saddles, harnesses, or
other equipment that might suggest they are mere
beasts of burden rather than trusted companions.
Giant eagles are long-lived and take debts and
oaths very seriously, often remembering slights for
years and remaining slow to forgive.

FLYTRAP TREASURE
Giant ﬂytraps have enough
instinctual intellect to eﬀectively
ambush prey or to move about to
seek out better hunting grounds,
but they don’t value treasure. Still,
a ﬂytrap tends to accumulate a
small wealth of discarded loot
from those it has eaten, discarding
these shiny baubles in the
periphery of its root system once it
has ﬁnished digesting its meal.
Flytrap
Flytraps are dangerous creatures as eager to feed on humanoids and larger prey
as they are monstrous insects.
Snapping Flytrap
The snapping ﬂytrap is a ravenous, carnivorous plant that is quick to bite at any
creature that passes by. Snapping ﬂytraps typically have two sets of tooth-edged
leaves, each measuring 3 feet wide, at the end of 10-foot-long stalks.

leaves the ﬂytrap has.

Demilich Eye Gems (arcane) A demilich has gemstone eyes that glow when the demilich
is active. Each eye contains an 8th-level spell that targets one creature (usually one
eye has maze and the other polar ray). The demilich can Activate an eye. This uses
the number of spellcasting actions the spell requires, and also requires command and
envision components. When the demilich casts a spell from a gemstone eye, that
eye stops glowing for 1d4 rounds, during which time that eye’s spell can’t be used.
Occasionally, one or both of the two demilich eye gems can be harvested from a
destroyed demilich as magic items (see below).
Devour Soul Ȱɵ (arcane, necromancy, negative) Requirements A soul has been trapped
in one of the demilich’s blight quartz gems (see Trap Soul) for 24 hours. Eﬀect The
demilich consumes the soul. The soul is utterly destroyed, and the demilich regains
HP equal to double the creature’s level.
Mental Magic A demilich can replace all material and somatic components for casting
spells with verbal components, and can replace all Interact components for activating
magic items with envision components.
Staﬀ Gems A demilich long ago absorbed the spells from a staﬀ into gemstone nodules
embedded in its skull, with larger nodules representing higher-level spells. It can cast
any of the spells as though it were Activating the staﬀ, and regains 1 charge per
4 hours spent in torpor, to a maximum of 8 charges. A typical demilich has the
spells from a greater staﬀ of necromancy, but it could have spells from
another staﬀ of 8th level or lower instead.
Trap Soul Ȱɵ command Frequency once per day per gem; Eﬀect Ten
blight quartz gemstones on the demilich’s skull can trap the
souls of the living. The Activated gem casts bind soul. This bind
soul can target and aﬀect a dying creature instead of a corpse.
The dying creature can attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save; if
it succeeds, it doesn’t die and its soul is not trapped but it’s
enervated 2 (or is unaﬀected entirely on a critical success).
When the soul of a creature gets trapped, the creature’s body
swiftly turns to dust.
The gemstones work like the black sapphires used in
bind soul, except that they can hold creatures of up to
17th level and have a value of 200 gp apiece. The demilich
can Devour a Soul it has trapped.

LINNORM KINGS
In the storied Lands of the
Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a
linnorm is traditionally required for
those who would claim a nation’s
crown. Recently, though, the
Linnorm King White Estrid claimed
her crown not by slaying a linnorm
but by beating it into submission,
gaining a powerful and dangerous
ally to help secure her rule.
Linnorm
Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate
those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inﬂict as much suffering as possible
upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be
the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible
strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality.
Crag Linnorm
Despite being among the weakest linnorms, the crag linnorm is a devastating
predator, capable of quickly cooking its foes with its magma breath.

save also takes 4d6 persistent ﬁre damage. The crag linnorm
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds. The magma
remains until the start of the linnorm's next turn. If the
linnorm was on the ground, the magma remains as a
burning line on the ground directly under the line of
the Breath Weapon, and if the linnorm was airborne,
the magma rains downward in a sheet 60 feet high.
Any creature that moves across or through the
magma takes 6d6 ﬁre damage (DC 34 basic Reﬂex

MEDUSA INFILTRATORS
Rumors persist of disguised
medusas acting as prominent
members of criminal organizations
such as the Sczarni in Riddleport and
the Aspis Consortium in Port Peril,
and their kind is known to thrive
in metropolises including Absalom
and Katapesh. Because they are so
widespread, medusas resembling
humans of every major ethnicity can
be found in Avistan and Garund.
Medusa
Monstrous humanoids that resemble humans with snakes instead of hair,
medusas are best known for their petrifying gazes that—if lingered upon—can
permanently transform mortals to stone. Medusas are shrewd and manipulative
adversaries who collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to
exploit the fears of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic
items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden
power, or inﬁltrate a society to beguile inﬂuential politicians. Their ability to
worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of
criminal outﬁts and thieves’ guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena
leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers ﬁnd what
they seek—for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufﬁcient, a
medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little
more than a glare.
Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from
a conﬂict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves
readied to resist the effects of a medusa’s gaze have nevertheless fallen to a
medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their
foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may
barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried
by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the
monster’s life.

petriﬁed permanently. After attempting its save, the creature is then
temporarily immune until the start of the medusa's next turn.

OTHER NAGAS
Beyond the sinister dark naga
and the benevolent guardian
naga, many other types of nagas
exist, including the mesmerizing
spirit naga, the multiheaded royal
naga, and the introspective and
mysterious lunar naga.
DC  25 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 5 minutes; Stage 1 slowed  1 (1 round);
Stage 2 slowed 2 (1 round); Stage 3 unconscious with no Perception check to
wake up (1d4+1 minutes)
Guardian Naga
The opposite of dark nagas in many ways, guardian nagas are benevolent and
wise protectors of places of great natural or supernatural signiﬁcance: ancient
oak groves, forgotten holy temples, and vaults of sacred power are just a few
examples of locations that these nagas protect. Guardian nagas believe that the
beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to
such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with
similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors
and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.
Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood,
to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to
protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place,
passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent
nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become
the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the
site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.
It is difﬁcult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of
evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately
for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see
encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and
expand worldviews.

NYMPH LOCATIONS
Nymphs tend to be closely
associated with speciﬁc areas of
natural splendor and beauty—
woodlands for dryads, rivers for
naiads. Areas where nymphs
dwell always look more pristine,
breathtaking, and scenic than they
would otherwise.
Languages Common, Elven, Sylvan; speak with plants
Skills Acrobatics +9, Athletics +5, Crafting +7 (+9 woodworking), Diplomacy +9,
Nature +13, Stealth +9, Survival +12
Str +0, Dex +4, Con +1, Int +2, Wis +3, Cha +4
Nature Empathy The dryad can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and make very
simple Requests of animals and plants.
AC 19; Fort +6, Ref +11, Will +10
HP 55; Weaknesses cold iron 5, ﬁre 5
Tree Dependent A dryad is mystically bonded to a single great tree and must remain
within 300 feet of it. If she moves beyond that range, she becomes sickened 1 and is
unable to recover. She must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save every hour or increase
the sickened value by 1 (to a maximum of sickened 4). After 24 hours, she becomes
drained 1, with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours. A dryad can
perform a 24-hour ritual to bond herself to a new tree.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ branch +12 (ﬁnesse, magical), Damage 1d12+2 bludgeoning
Primal Innate Spells DC 21, attack +11; 5th tree stride (×2); 4th charm (×3), suggestion;
3rd sleep; 2nd entangle (at will), tree shape (at will); Cantrips
(2nd) tanglefoot; Constant (4th) speak with plants
Tree Meld ʚʖ (primal, transmutation) The dryad touches a tree of
enough volume to contain her and merges into it for as long as she
wishes. She can Cast a Spell while inside as long as the spell doesn’t
require a line of eﬀect outside the tree. She can hear, but not
see, what’s going on outside the tree. She can
Dismiss this eﬀect.
Signiﬁcant physical damage dealt to the
tree expels the dryad from the tree and deals
3d6 damage to her. Passwall expels the dryad
without dealing damage.
If a dryad uses this ability on her bonded tree, she instead enters an
extradimensional living space within the tree; Tree Meld gains the
extradimensional trait. A dryad can bring up to two other creatures
with her when entering her home within her bonded tree. The dryad
can still be expelled from this space as above.
Nymph Queens
Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of
untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of
nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and
more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad
queens as simply “nymphs.”
Nymph Queen Abilities
A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same
type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph
queen’s ward is a signiﬁcant region, and she strengthens and viviﬁes this territory
with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the
corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain
the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the
nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based
on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow
a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to
change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Nymph queens can transform
between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and
any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking
version of their natural form.

OTHER NYMPHS
Naiads and dryads are the most well-
known nymphs, but others exist as
well. Hesperides, for example, are
wards of the sunset and golden light
and can be encountered dwelling on
coastal cliﬀsides or remote islands.
Lampads, on the other hand, are
dark, moody nymphs found in
wondrous,
crystal-lined
caverns
deep underground.
Focus Beauty Ȱɵ (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen
focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a
Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty
aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in
the nymph queen’s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature
only once per turn.
Inspiration ̂ˬ (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A nymph queen can inspire a
single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock
of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing
with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks,
Performance checks, and Will saves.
If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s
muse, the bard gains an additional beneﬁt depending on their muse theme: for lore muse,
the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status
bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the eﬀects
of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill
checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.
Nymph’s Beauty (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures
that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suﬀer an eﬀect
described in the nymph queen’s entry.
Tied to the Land A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a speciﬁc region, such as a forest
for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally
resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and
rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a
counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph
queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region
eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph
queen swiftly heals the entire region.
Naiad Queen
Naiad queens rule over pristine wildernesses centered on untouched lakes or other
bodies of fresh water. Bards’ songs and artists’ paintings of nymphs tend to depict
naiad queens in their slightly more humanoid forms, which they don when they
make the rare journey into civilized lands to garner allies or gauge threats.
Most naiad queens treat those who respect their domains with kindness, but
they are ﬁerce and quick in eliminating foes. Their blinding beauty and breadth of
offensive spells make naiad queens ﬁerce opponents if forced into a ﬁght.

GIANT OCTOPUS LAIRS
Giant octopuses favor shipwrecks,
coral reefs, or underwater caverns
as lairs, where they can take
advantage of narrow conﬁnes
for protection. Giant octopuses,
like their smaller kin, are fond
of adorning and decorating their
lairs with found objects—many of
which, in the giant octopus’s case,
are also magical weapons, shields,
or works of art salvaged from
sunken ships or fallen adventurers.

without triggering reactions.
Writhing Arms ʚʖ The giant octopus makes up to four Strikes with diﬀerent arms, each
against a diﬀerent target. Each attack counts separately for the octopus’s multiple attack
penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase the penalty until the octopus has made all
the attacks. If the octopus subsequently
uses the Grab action, it can Grab
any number of creatures it hit
with Writhing Arms.

RAJA HEADS
Raja's heads often resemble those
of cats or snakes, but they can
also be similar to apes, jackals,
vultures, elephants, mantises,
lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are
possible. In most cases, the type
of head a raja rakshasa possesses
symbolizes its personality—a
tiger-headed one is stealthy and
ravenous, while a boar-headed one
might be gluttonous and crude.
Raja Rakshasa
When not disguised as a humanoid, the raja rakshasa has the head of an animal.
The hands of a raja rakshasa are more subtly unsettling, for the ﬁngers of these
ﬁends bend outward, away from the palms.
More than any other types of rakshasa, rajas scoff at religion. They understand
the power of the divine, yet they view themselves as the only things worthy
of worship from mortal creatures; not even their own immortals are deemed
deserving of such gloriﬁcation. Raja rakshasas often form close-knit families that
work together to bring down mortal cities or to rule them from the shadows
within. Such families of rakshasas often incorporate other breeds of the ﬁend,
often using dandasukas as favored servants or stealthy spies. Even though a raja
family works together to achieve a shared goal, inﬁghting and treachery among
their own is a constant threat.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The raja rakshasa
takes on the appearance of any Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change the
raja rakshasa’s Speed or its attack and damage modiﬁers with its Strikes but
might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). It
typically loses its fangs Strike unless the humanoid form has fangs or a similar
unarmed attack.
Disturbing Vision Ȱɵ (concentrate, enchantment, mental, occult) The raja rakshasa’s
eyes ﬂash green as it projects a telepathic wave in a 30-foot emanation. All
creatures in the area are assailed by a vision of evil decadence from one of
the rakshasa’s past lives. Each non-evil creature in the area must succeed at
a DC 29 Will save or become sickened 1 (and stunned 1 on a critical
failure). The visions last 1d4 rounds, and while they do, the
raja rakshasa and all evil creatures in the area gain a
+1 status bonus to all checks. The raja rakshasa can
use this ability again only once the previous visions end.

DREAD WRAITHS
Dread wraiths are much more
powerful variants of the standard
wraith. A dread wraith is a
9th‑level creature that can drain
the life from creatures via its
mere presence. Often, a dread
wraith commands a small group
of normal wraiths, and in life may
have been a bloodthirsty warlord
or brutal general.
Wraith
Wraiths are malevolent undead who drain life and shun light. Their shadowy,
incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reﬂect their hatred for the
living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their
enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are
the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up
their wicked ways. Further complicating the matter is the fact that wraiths multiply
by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind—meaning a
handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness.
Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt
any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight
conﬁnes them to the shadowy places of the world—places where they can blend
in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulﬁng their prey.
Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death
and mayhem are commonplace—countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan
underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of ﬁendish cultic rituals. In these
places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins,
sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as
the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough
to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous
caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas.
As they’re formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths
pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead,
wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They’re among the ruling class in
Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards
and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of
the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs,
typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.

Speed ﬂy 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ spectral hand +17 (ﬁnesse), Damage 2d8+5 negative plus drain life
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the wraith damages a living
creature with its spectral hand Strike, the wraith gains 5 temporary
Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save
or become drained 1. Further damage dealt by the wraith increases
the amount of drain by 1 on a failed save to a maximum of drained 4.
Wraith Spawn (divine, necromancy) A living humanoid slain by a wraith’s
spectral hand Strike rises as a wraith spawn after 1d4 rounds. This wraith
spawn is under the command of the wraith that killed it. It doesn’t have drain life or
wraith spawn and becomes clumsy 2 for as long as it is a wraith spawn. If the creator
of the wraith spawn dies, the wraith spawn becomes a full-ﬂedged, autonomous
wraith; it regains its free will, gains Wraith Spawn, and is no longer clumsy.
