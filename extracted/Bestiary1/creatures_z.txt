# ZARAMUUN
================================================================================


ZARAMUUN TREASURE
Zaramuuns collect treasure from
mortals they have robbed or
sacriﬁced. They are attracted to
gems, rare metals, and potent
pieces of crafted earth, particularly
powerful magic items associated
with the Plane of Earth.
Zaramuun
Zaramuuns are beings of elemental sand that hide in deserts and wastelands. They
disguise themselves as massive dunes before rising up to attack living creatures. The
most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they ﬁnd, but others simply rob
their victims of all metal and stone possessions before ﬂeeing. Although zaramuuns
insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral earth, this is
simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as payment and material
components to conjure ﬁends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from the Plane of Earth
after worshipping ﬁends who promised to give them power over other elementals.
This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many zaramuuns believe
that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be set free.

CREATING ZOMBIES
To create a zombie creature, start
with a zombie of the appropriate
size. Then add any Strikes, Speeds,
or other abilities it would gain from
its shape. To create a Gargantuan
zombie, begin with the zombie hulk,
apply the elite adjustments, change
its size to Gargantuan, and increase
its reach by 5 feet.
Zombie
A zombie’s only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling
harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they’re destroyed.
Zombie Abilities
You can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities. Most zombies have
one of these abilities; If you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its
level and adjust its statistics.
Disgusting Pustules (disease, necromancy) The zombie is covered in pustules that
rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit. In either case, adjacent
creatures are hit with vile ﬂuid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they
succeed at a Fortitude save.
Feast ʚʖ (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature,
or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its ﬂesh
to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie’s level. If the
creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, ﬁst, or claw damage.
Plague-Ridden (disease, necromancy) The zombie carries a plague that can create more
of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie’s zombie rot, except at stage 5,
the victim rises as another of the zombie’s type, rather than a plague zombie.
Rotting Aura (aura, disease, necromancy) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease
that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn
within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its
wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has.
Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately.
Unkillable This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing
and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains
weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie’s
level by 1 if you give it this ability.
Zombie Shambler
A zombie shambler is a slow-moving horror dangerous in larger groups.

Ability Glossary
The following creature abilities are listed here because
they are shared by many creatures or are highly complex.
The statistics for individual creatures might alter the
traits, the number of actions, or other rules of these
abilities. Anything noted in a speciﬁc creature’s stat
block overrides the general rules for the ability below.
In these abilities, “monster” is used for the creature
that has the ability, to differentiate it from any other
creatures the ability might affect.
All-Around Vision This monster can see in all directions
simultaneously, and therefore can’t be ﬂanked.
Aquatic Ambush Ȱɵ Requirements The monster is hiding in
water and a creature that hasn’t detected it is within the
listed number of feet. Eﬀect The monster moves up to
its swim Speed + 10 feet toward the triggering creature,
traveling on water and on land. Once the creature is in
reach, the monster makes a Strike against it. The creature is
ﬂat-footed against this Strike.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Trigger A creature within the
monster’s reach uses a manipulate action or a move action,
makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move
action it’s using. Eﬀect The monster attempts a melee Strike
against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical
hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster
disrupts that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward the
monster’s multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack
penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
At-Will Spells The monster can cast its at-will spells any
number of times without using up spell slots.
Aura A monster’s aura automatically aﬀects everything within
a speciﬁed emanation around that monster. The monster
doesn’t need to spend actions on the aura; rather, the aura’s
eﬀects are applied at speciﬁc times, such as when a creature
ends its turn in the aura or when creatures enter the aura.
If an aura does nothing but deal damage, its entry lists
only the radius, damage, and saving throw. Such auras deal
this damage to a creature when the creature enters the aura
and when a creature starts its turn in the aura. A creature
can take damage from the aura only once per round.
The GM might determine that a monster’s aura doesn’t
aﬀect its own allies. For example, a creature might be
immune to a monster’ frightful presence if they have been
around each other for a long time.
Buck Ǻȓ Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to
buck oﬀ unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts
will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless
the mounts are spooked or mistreated. Trigger A creature
Mounts or uses the Command an Animal action while riding
the monster. Eﬀect The triggering creature must succeed
at a Reﬂex saving throw against the listed DC or fall oﬀ the
creature and land prone. If the save is a critical failure, the
triggering creature also takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage in
addition to the normal damage for the fall.
Catch Rock Ǻȓ Requirements The monster must have a free hand
but can Release anything it’s holding as part of this reaction.
Trigger The monster is targeted with a thrown rock Strike
or a rock would fall on the monster. Eﬀect The monster
gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its AC against the
triggering attack or to any defense against the falling rock.
If the attack misses or the monster successfully defends
against the falling rock, the monster catches the rock, takes
no damage, and is now holding the rock.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, [magical tradition], polymorph,
transmutation) The monster changes its shape indeﬁnitely.
It can use this action again to return to its natural shape
or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster
cannot use Change Shape to appear as a speciﬁc individual.
Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the
Impersonate use of Deception. The monster’s transformation
automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether
the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type
into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to
its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its
disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the
monster can adopt. The monster doesn’t gain any special
abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For
example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and
Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any
changes are listed in its stat block.
Constant Spells A constant spell aﬀects the monster without the
monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited. If a
constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can reactivate it
by spending the normal spellcasting actions the spell requires.
Constrict Ȱɵ The monster deals the listed amount of damage
to any number of creatures grabbed or restrained by it.
Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save
with the listed DC.
Coven (divination, mental, occult) This monster can form a
coven with two or more other creatures who also have the
coven ability. This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony
with all prospective coven members. After the coven is
formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments (page
6), adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can
sense other members’ locations and conditions by spending
a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can
sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-
action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.
Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but
these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven
members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven
member can contribute to a coven spell with a single-action
spellcasting activity that has a single verbal component. If
two coven members have contributed these actions within
the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her
turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven
can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times
but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens
grant the 8th-level baleful polymorph spell and all the
following spells, which the coven can cast at any level up
to 5th: augury, charm, clairaudience, clairvoyance, dream
message, illusory disguise, illusory scene, prying eye, and
talking corpse. Individual creatures with the coven ability

also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven
can also cast the control weather ritual (Core Rulebook 411),
with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.
If a coven member leaving the coven or the death of a
coven member brings the coven below three members,
the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for
24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the
necessary actions, they can’t cast coven spells.
Darkvision A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well
in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in
black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such
as a 4th-level darkness spell, block normal darkvision. A
monster with greater darkvision, however, can see through
even these forms of magical darkness.
Disease When a creature is exposed to a monster’s disease, it
attempts a Fortitude save or succumbs to the disease. The
level of a disease is the level of the monster inﬂicting the
disease. The disease follows the rules for aﬄictions found
on page 457 of the Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook.
Engulf ʚʖ The monster Strides up to double its Speed and can
move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any
creature of the monster’s size or smaller whose space the
monster moves through can attempt a Reﬂex save with the
listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act
automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds
at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the
monster’s path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of
the monster’s movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf
the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The
monster can contain as many creatures as can ﬁt in its space.
A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster’s
body. It is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath
or start suﬀocating. The creature takes the listed amount
of damage when ﬁrst engulfed and at the end of each of
its turns while it’s engulfed. An engulfed creature can get
free by Escaping against the listed escape DC. An engulfed
creature can attack the monster engulﬁng it, but only with
unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The
engulﬁng creature is ﬂat-footed against the attack. If the
monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or
exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or
spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that
gets free by either method can immediately breathe and
exits the swallowing monster’s space.
If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are
automatically released as the monster’s form loses cohesion.
Fast Healing A monster with this ability regains the given
number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn.
Ferocity Ǻȓ Trigger The monster is reduced to 0 HP. Eﬀect The
monster avoids being knocked out and remains at 1 HP, but
its wounded value increases by 1. When it is wounded 3, it
can no longer use this ability.
Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) A creature that
ﬁrst enters the area must attempt a Will save. Regardless of
the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily
immune to this monster’s Frightful Presence for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected by the presence.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is frightened 4.
Grab Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was a
success with a Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry,
or it has a creature grabbed using this action. Eﬀect The
monster automatically Grabs the target until the end of the
monster’s next turn. The creature is grabbed by whichever
body part the monster attacked with, and that body part
can’t be used to Strike creatures until the grab is ended.
Using Grab extends the duration of the monster’s Grab
until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it.
A grabbed creature can use the Escape action to get out of
the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the
monster moves away from it.
Greater Constrict Ȱɵ The monster deals the listed amount of
damage to any number of creatures grabbed or restrained
by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude
save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save
falls unconscious, and a creature that succeeds is then
temporarily immune to falling unconscious from Greater
Constrict for 1 minute.
Improved Grab, Improved Knockdown, or Improved Push Ȳ˓ The
monster can use Grab, Knockdown, or Push (as appropriate)
as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack. A
monster with Improved Grab still needs to spend an action
to extend the duration for creatures it already has grabbed.
Knockdown Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was
a success with a Strike that lists Knockdown in its damage
entry. Eﬀect The monster knocks the target prone.
Lifesense Lifesense allows a monster to sense the vital essence
of living and undead creatures within the listed range. The
sense can distinguish between the positive energy animating
living creatures and the negative energy animating undead
creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors.
Light Blindness When ﬁrst exposed to bright light, the
monster is blinded until the end of its next turn. After this
exposure, light doesn’t blind the monster again until after it
spends 1 hour in darkness. However, as long as the monster
is in an area of bright light, it’s dazzled.
Low-Light Vision The monster can see in dim light as though
it were bright light, so it ignores the concealed condition
due to dim light.
Poison When a creature is exposed to a monster’s poison, it
attempts a Fortitude save to avoid becoming poisoned. The
level of a poison is the level of the monster inﬂicting the
poison. The poison follows the rules for aﬄictions found on
page 457 of the Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook.
Push Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was a success
with a Strike that lists Push in its damage entry. Eﬀect The
monster automatically knocks the target away from the
monster. Unless otherwise noted in the ability description,
the creature is pushed 5 feet. If the attack was a critical hit,
this distance is doubled.
Regeneration This monster regains the listed number of Hit
Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its dying
condition never increases beyond dying 3 as long as its

regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type
listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates
until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration
before applying any damage of a listed type, since that
damage might kill the monster by bringing it to dying 4.
Rend Ȱɵ A Rend entry lists a Strike the monster has.
Requirements The monster hit the same enemy with two
consecutive Strikes of the listed type in the same round.
Eﬀect The monster automatically deals that Strike’s damage
again to the enemy.
Retributive Strike Ǻȓ Trigger An enemy damages the
monster’s ally, and both are within 15 feet of the monster.
Eﬀect The ally gains resistance to all damage against the
triggering damage equal to 2 + the monster’s level. If the foe
is within reach, the monster makes a melee Strike against it.
Scent Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and
is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability,
and it functions only if the creature or object being detected
emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually
do not exude an aroma).
If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM
can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to
detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a
creature is downwind.
Shield Block Ǻȓ Trigger The monster has its shield raised and
takes damage from a physical attack. Eﬀect The monster snaps
its shield into place to deﬂect a blow. The shield prevents the
monster from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s
Hardness. The monster and the shield each take any remaining
damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield.
Sneak Attack When the monster Strikes a creature that has
the ﬂat-footed condition with an agile or ﬁnesse melee
weapon, an agile or ﬁnesse unarmed attack, or a ranged
weapon attack, it also deals the listed precision damage. For
a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, that weapon must
also be an agile or ﬁnesse weapon.
Swallow Whole Ȱɵ (attack) The monster attempts to swallow
a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed in
its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum
size listed, the monster can’t use Swallow Whole again.
If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster
can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines
the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check
opposed by the grabbed creature’s Reﬂex DC. If it succeeds,
it swallows the creature. The monster’s mouth or jaws no
longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is
free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster
can’t attack creatures it has swallowed.
A swallowed creature is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to
hold its breath or start suﬀocating. The swallowed creature
takes the listed amount of damage when ﬁrst swallowed and
at the end of each of its turns while it’s swallowed. If the victim
Escapes this ability’s grabbed condition, it exits through the
monster’s mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the
monster’s mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack
the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed
attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulﬁng
creature is ﬂat-footed against the attack. If the monster takes
piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed
Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed
creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either
Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and
exits the swallowing monster’s space.
If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by
creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined
total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon
or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.
Swarm Mind This monster doesn’t have a single mind
(typically because it’s a swarm of smaller creatures), and is
immune to mental eﬀects that target only a speciﬁc number
of creatures. It is still subject to mental eﬀects that aﬀect all
creatures in an area.
Telepathy (aura, divination, magical) A monster with telepathy
can communicate mentally with any creatures within the
listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn’t
give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates
no more information than normal speech would.
Throw Rock Ȱɵ The monster picks up a rock within reach or
retrieves a stowed rock and throws it, making a ranged Strike.
Trample ̂ˬ The monster Strides up to double its Speed and
can move through the spaces of creatures of the listed size,
Trampling each creature whose space it enters. The monster
can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single
use of Trample. The monster deals the damage of the listed
Strike, but trampled creatures can attempt a basic Reﬂex
save at the listed DC (no damage on a critical success, half
damage on a success, double damage on a critical failure).
Tremorsense Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the
vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is
an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability).
Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same
surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along
(or burrowing through) the surface.
Wavesense This sense allows a monster to feel vibrations caused
by movement through a liquid. It’s an imprecise sense with a
limited range (listed in the ability). Wavesense functions only
if monster and the subject are in the same body of liquid, and
only if the subject is moving through the liquid.
Creature Traits
Some of these traits appear in the Pathﬁnder Core
Rulebook, while others are new to this book.
Rarity Traits
Unless the creature is common, its trait list starts with a
rarity trait. Creatures that don’t start with a rarity trait
have the common rarity.
Common A creature of this rarity is generally known and can
be summoned with the appropriate summon spell.
Uncommon Less is known about uncommon creatures than
common creatures. They typically can’t be summoned. The
DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to this creature is
increased by 2.
Rare As the name suggests, these creatures are rare. They

Alignment Trait Abbreviation
Following any listed rarity trait is one of nine alignment
trait abbreviations. They are listed below with the
alignment traits that these abbreviations represent.
General descriptions of alignments are found on pages
28–29 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook.
CE Chaotic and evil
CG Chaotic and good
CN Chaotic and neutral
LG Lawful and good
LE Lawful and evil
LN Lawful and neutral
N Neutral
NE Neutral and evil
NG Neutral and good
Size
After any listed rarity trait and the alignment abbreviation,
each creature has its size listed before its traits.
Gargantuan This size of creature takes up a space of at least
20 feet by 20 feet (16 squares on the grid), but can be much
larger. Gargantuan creatures typically have a reach of 20
feet if they are tall, or 15 feet if they are long, but larger
ones could have a much longer reach.
Huge A Huge creature takes up a 15-foot-by-15-foot space
(9 squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 15 feet if
the creature is tall or 10 feet if the creature is long.
Large A Large creature takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot space
(4 squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 10 feet if
the creature is tall or 5 feet if the creature is long.
Medium A Medium creature takes up a 5-foot-by-5-foot space
(1 square on the grid) and typically has a reach of 5 feet.
Small A Small creature takes up a 5-foot-by-5-foot space
(1 square on the grid) and typically has a reach of 5 feet.
Tiny A creature of this size takes up less than a 5-foot-by-5-
foot space (1 square on the grid), and multiple Tiny creatures
can occupy the same square on the grid. At least four Tiny
creatures can occupy the same square, and even more can
occupy the same square, at the GM’s discretion. They can
also occupy the same space as larger creatures, and if their
reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.

After any rarity traits, the alignment abbreviation, and
the size trait, each creature’s trait line lists all other traits

WEAPON TRAITS
The creatures in this book use one new trait—brutal—
and list the ﬁnesse trait diﬀerently. The bonuses from
these traits are already included in creatures’ statistics,
but the traits are still shown because they’re relevant
for the clumsy and enfeebled conditions.
Brutal: A ranged attack with this trait uses its Strength
modiﬁer instead of Dexterity on the attack roll.
Finesse: This melee attack is Dexterity-based. Even if a
weapon normally has the ﬁnesse trait, this trait is omitted
in the Strike entry if the monster is applying its Strength.
