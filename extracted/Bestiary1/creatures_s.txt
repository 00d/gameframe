Alghollthu
In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult
powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained
countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their
slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative
magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this
meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further
shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the
heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these
societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horriﬁcally
transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.
In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave
societies and sought to wipe the slate clean—both starting anew and punishing
those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical
power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they’d
manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of
their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew
strong once again—this time without alghollthu inﬂuence.
Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation
of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic
realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their
plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a
frightening possibility—that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the
surface once again.
Skum (Ulat-Kini)
The most numerous of the alghollthus are the
ulat-kinis, a servitor race created from human stock
to serve as rank-and-ﬁle soldiers in alghollthu armies.
At the zenith of alghollthu power, ulat-kinis formed
massive legions and enjoyed signiﬁcant power over other species. When the
alghollthus retreated from the world, they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile soldiers tried to continue their conquering
ways, their numbers declined rapidly in battleﬁeld defeats and purposeful
exterminations enacted by their enemies. Ulat-kini society
degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist
in the depths of the earth or along isolated
coastlines. Few remember their own species’
name, instead using the epithet their foes
gave them: “skum.”

Faceless Stalker (Ugothol)
Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols—also known as
faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to inﬁltrate settlements
and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders, causing
unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and
eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend
alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their
aquatic masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today,
most faceless stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed
goals without the guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live
as close to the sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures
themselves. Most dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers
of coastal towns.
By instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in
humanoid societies, then guide inﬁltrated settlements down paths of destruction.
Among humanoids who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become
a prominent trailblazer, leading a group to new heights of depravity and
violence. Inevitably, however, faceless stalker inﬁltrators lead their followers
to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves on—either because its true nature
is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled or devastated all
local resources.
An ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking
tongue. Their prey bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major
arteries. Corpses bearing such marks are typically the ﬁrst clues found
to uncover a faceless stalker’s presence, though sometimes they are
overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.

ANCIENT INFLUENCES
The veiled masters inﬂuenced the
ancient Azlanti, and it was they who
invoked the apocalypse of Earthfall
to destroy Azlant when humanity
grew too prideful. That this act also
called down the magical Starstone,
an artifact capable of transforming
mortals into gods, was an ironic
turn of events considering the
alghollthus’ intolerance for faith.

AZATA DIVINITIES
The most powerful of all azatas
belong to the cast of demigods
known as empyreal lords. These
lesser deities maintain many cults
across many Material Plane worlds,
and count among their kind such
diverse demigods as Ashava, a
protector of lost spirits and dancer
in the moonlight; Black Butterﬂy,
a mysterious agent of Desna and
patron of the depths of outer space;
and Sinashakti, joyful wanderer and
deliverer of wisdom to vagabonds.
Azata
Azatas are manifestations of freedom—kindly celestials with a penchant for
curious exploration, spontaneous revelry, and whimsical quests. Born of the
untamable wilds of Elysium, azatas are passionate and mercurial, but also ﬁercely
loyal to those they hold dear. Azatas act quickly and directly against ﬁendish and
otherworldly inﬂuences, but they tend to stay out of mortal affairs otherwise,
allowing them the ultimate freedom to choose their own destiny. While all
azatas cherish freedom, each type exempliﬁes a particular freedom above others.
Many of their kind hold strange knightly and courtly titles that defy mortal
classiﬁcation and shift and change with time and on different occasions rather
than following a strict hierarchy. This bafﬂes archons and other more lawful
creatures who haven’t had much contact with azatas. In actuality, the azatas use
their titles as personal ﬂourishes and points of pride, rather than as excuses to
order each other around.
Lyrakien (Wanderer Azata)
Lyrakiens are musical messengers and embodiments of free travel. They serve
Desna and other deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, but are quite fond of
the concept of free time and are always on the hunt for opportunities to pause
in their duties to enjoy music or appreciate a moment of beauty.
They love contests, stories, and songs, and they often challenge
mortals to musical contests or pester them to share grand tales of
their exploits. Lyrakiens rely on their agility to avoid conﬂicts, but
they do their best to defend places of great natural beauty, especially
against lawful or evil foes they can damage with their starlight.
Lyrakiens have an innate wanderlust and rarely stay in the same place
for very long. Some travel alongside adventurers, ofter writing songs
about their quests and feats of derring-do.
Though light-hearted creatures, lyrakiens don’t let their whimsical
personalities get in the way of protecting breathtaking natural
locations. Often called “glistenwings” by gnomes and halﬂings, they
are frequently mistaken for sprites or similar fey, a bit of confusion
that many lyrakiens ﬁnd amusing and fertile ground for shenanigans
involving those they deem deserving of a bit of unexpected fun and
discord in their lives.

Catfolk
Lithe and agile, with catlike features and long tails, the amurruns are wanderers,
explorers, and extroverts who share a gregarious nature and an unbridled
curiosity. This latter characteristic leads many individual amurruns into trouble,
yet this inquisitiveness is paired with a penchant for good fortune that offsets
much of their self-induced peril. They accept the term “catfolk” as a name for
their people with grace and a hint of amusement.
Ever eager to explore and learn, catfolk have spread to other parts of the world
from their native nations in the southern tropics, yet never in large groups. A lone
catfolk can be found anywhere in the world, but it’s rare to ﬁnd a settlement beyond
their traditional national borders. This is due to their innate wanderlust and insatiable
wonder. As many a catfolk might say, “I’ve lived with my people my whole life, but
you? You’re new and different! There’s so much to learn from you!”
Longstanding amurrun legends claim the catfolk were ﬁrst created as guardians
and were then charged with protecting the world from those sinister forces
that exist at its fringes. Often, this charge manifests as a longstanding
opposition to cultists of demon lords, archdevils, and other
ﬁendish demigods. Many catfolk worship the spirits
of creation, using serendipitous rituals to attract
good fortune and banish ill luck in the spirits’
name, while others venerate their own
small pantheon of divinities. Those who
travel often ﬁnd comfort in the worship
of Desna, whose teachings closely match
their own predilections.
Catfolk adapt well to adventuring roles,
and can be quite diverse in their areas
of study and specialization. Those who
follow the traditions of rangers and rogues are
perhaps the most commonly encountered, but not
overwhelmingly so. Their natural curiosity leads some
catfolk to take up mystical arts, training as wizards or following
a divine path to become clerics.

its discreet inhabitants do not

Indeed, few adventurers from the
Inner Sea region have managed
to gain entrance to Murraseth, let
alone discover any of its mysteries.

WHAT MAKES A SIN?
Some classify sin into seven
categories—envy, gluttony, greed,
lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While
these sins embody some of the most
powerful and numerous demons, far
more than seven demons exist. Any
act of cruelty or destruction a mortal
takes to gratify the self at others’
expense is, in eﬀect, a sin, and any
such act can spawn a
demon from a soul in
the afterlife.
The target must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or be aﬀected by a suggestion to submit
to more actions of passion rather than trying to Escape.
Profane Gift ̂ˬ (divine, enchantment, mental); Frequency once per day. Eﬀect The
succubus on can give a willing humanoid a profane gift. That creature gains a +1 status
bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. As long as the gift persists, the
succubus can communicate telepathically with the target at any distance, see through
the creature’s senses, and target the creature with suggestion through the telepathic
link. In addition, the creature uses an outcome one degree of success worse than it rolls
on saving throws against the lust demon’s suggestions.
A humanoid can’t have more than one profane gift at a time, and a succubus can’t
grant more than one profane gift at a time. Removing the gift requires an atone ritual. The
succubus can remove the gift as a free action to give the recipient a permanent stupeﬁed
3 condition. A 4th-level restoration spell is required to reduce this stupeﬁed condition by 1.
A summoned succubus can’t grant a profane gift.
Vrock (Wrath Demon)
When the gates to the Abyss swing wide, the ﬁrst demons through are often
vrocks, vulture-headed scions of rage who wheel through the air on black wings
or dance with the exultation of their ﬁendish power. Their hatred for mortals is
matched only by their desire to inﬂict suffering through
their horrible screech or their devastating dance.
Vrocks form from the souls of hateful mortals
who are thus given another chance to inﬂict their
rage on the world.
Vrocks often travel in small groups so as to make the
best use of their dance of ruin ability, but they rarely
appear in groups larger than four. Against small groups
and individuals, they swoop down without fear, hoping
to play with their prey before going for the kill. Against
formidable foes, they are just as happy to ﬂy above, using
their dance of ruin to cast a storm of lightning down on them.

The sprawling, heaving, changing

home of demonic life,
but demons can be found
anywhere the capacity to

The shemhazian focuses their gaze
on a non-evil creature they can see
within 30 feet. If that creature isn’t
already slowed by the shemhazian’s
paralyzing gaze, it must attempt a save
against the shemhazian’s paralyzing gaze. If that
creature is slowed, it must succeed at a DC 35
Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round. A
shemhazian can’t use this ability against the
same creature more than once per round.

Marilith (Pride Demon)
Mariliths are the generals of the Abyss, formed from the souls of proud evil
mortals, often warlords and despots. They appear as tall and powerfully built
humans from the waist up with snake tails and six arms. Because of Lamashtu’s
prominence over other demonic deities, most pride demons encountered by
mortals take female form, but they can be of any gender.
Mariliths are among the greatest tacticians in the Abyss, and they have an
almost supernatural knack for understanding the ripples of chaos and the
unpredictable nature of demonic life. Their ability to command armies rises as
much from their commanding presence as it does their ability to read into the
potential results of any possible act and a sufﬁcient understanding of the ﬂow of
entropy to allow them to predict likely outcomes.

PRIMEVAL LANDS
Dinosaurs ﬁt well into certain
types of settings. They’re
often found in isolated lands
like primeval jungle valleys or
plateaus—regions known as lost
worlds for their inaccessibility
and lack of any encroaching
civilization. In addition to
dinosaurs, other megafauna
can exist in these places as
well, along with giant insects or
aggressive creatures like bulettes,
carnivorous plants, chuuls, and
drakes. Such regions can make for
perilous and intriguing adventure
sites, especially if you combine
them with ruins of ancient
civilizations to explore once the
party has navigated the hostile
wilderness regions.
against other triceratopses for grazing territory or mates. Short-tempered and
obstinate, triceratopses are unlikely to back down from a ﬁght unless they are
hopelessly outmatched, and the creatures are known to ﬁght to the death for
no apparent reason beyond stubbornness. Triceratopses often serve as mounts
for lizardfolk, orcs, and giants, who ride comfortably behind the dinosaurs’
protective bone frills. A triceratops is 30 feet long and weighs as much as 10 tons.
Triceratopses are surely the most well-known of the dinosaurs known as
ceratopids, but many others exist. For example, the smaller styracosauruses
have only one horn but several horn-like protrusions on their frills.

Brontosauruses are truly gigantic
behemoths, plodding herbivores
large enough to be unafraid of all
but the most massive predators.
Brontosauruses have stout bodies
and long, sinuous necks ending in
small heads, allowing them to graze
from the highest treetops. Their powerful tails are equally
as long as their necks and provide counterbalances.
Brontosauruses bear their bulk upon four stout legs.
Although their feet are capable of crushing entire buildings,
these herbivores are generally peaceful and considerate of
where they step.
Most brontosauruses are dangerous only when defending
themselves or their young, or when panicked enough
to stampede. When roused in this way, however, the
creatures are truly terrifying: their muscular tails sweep
in great arcs and their massive feet crash down
heedlessly onto the ground. A brontosaurus is 70
feet long and weighs more than 30 tons.

GIANT LOCATIONS
As oversized as they are, giants
tend to dwell in remote regions of
the world, where they have the

larger territories of
their own.

Frost Giant
Frost giants are remorseless marauders who
pillage and plunder from those who dare to live near
them in desolate, frigid lands. Their clans range from extremely
territorial hunters who claim an expanse of tundra and defend
it at all costs to nomadic hordes that roam icy slopes in
search of settlements to conquer. Frost giant clans are
ruled by those who exhibit the greatest ferocity and
prowess in battle—massive brutes who proclaim
themselves jarl and demand absolute obedience from
their followers. If at any time a frost giant wishes to
be a jarl, all they must do is issue a challenge to the
current jarl and face off in mortal combat, after which
the reigning champion continues leading the clan or the
victorious challenger assumes control.
Frost giants live in frostbitten realms, and their
appearance is reﬂective of a people weathered and hardened by
relentless snowstorms and freezing temperatures. They often wear
metal armor adorned with the furs, skin, teeth, and tusks of slain
beasts and heft weapons as long as dining tables. Their ﬂesh ranges
from pale blue to shale gray, and their hair is typically a dingy white or
dirty yellow color.
A typical frost giant stands about 15 feet tall and weighs
approximately 2,800 pounds.

Iron Golem
Traditionally crafted into the forms of giant suits of armor or powerful animals,
iron golems are products of exquisite artistry and skill. Their articulated joints
and sturdy armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft,
and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don’t rust over the ages. With proper
care, iron golems can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being
passed down for generations, as long as they aren’t destroyed by meddlesome
adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron golems possess a
potent toxic breath weapon that is often more than enough to dispatch entire
groups of opponents.

HAG COVENS
Hags are dangerous enough on
their own, but when they gather in
threes to form covens, they grow
much more powerful. Full rules for
covens appear on page 342.
Green Hag
Green hags hate beauty and purity, so they use disguises and treachery to lure and
murder innocents, corrupt the pure of heart, and shatter the minds and morals of
their victims. Green hags create imaginative schemes to utterly ruin anyone who
crosses them, as well as good or righteous folk whose very existence insults the
hag’s twisted sensibilities. The complicated scandals perpetuated by green hags
involve impersonation, mistaken identity, the seduction and betrayal of loved
ones, or all these things in combination.

The green hag can take on the appearance of any Medium
humanoid woman. This doesn’t change her Speed or
her attack and damage bonuses with her Strikes, but
might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically
to bludgeoning).
Enfeebling Humors (necromancy, occult) A creature damaged
by a hag’s claw must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or
be enfeebled 1 for 1 day. On a critical failure, or if it gets hit
again and fails its save a second time, it’s enfeebled 2 for 1 day.
Exhale Miasma ʚʖ (necromancy, occult) The green hag exhales
a miasma of green vapors. Each living creature in a 15-foot
cone is aﬀected by her enfeebling humors (attempting a save as
normal). She can’t use Exhale Miasma again for 1d4 rounds.
Annis Hag
Annis hags are brutal torturers and murderers, delighting in the musical
screams and tasty ﬂesh of young creatures and those who are pure of
heart. Annis hags are the most direct of all hags, engaging in physical combat
and using their change shape ability to hunt rather than to inﬁltrate and betray
humanoids. But an Annis hag takes a grisly trophy from each kill and uses
it to sow discord, sending the trophy to one of her victim’s loved
ones in a way that implicates another family member in the murder.
Also known as iron hags, annis hags have iron-like yet ﬂexible ﬂesh
that resists edged weapons, and their own touch is the same cold iron
that burns the ﬂesh of other hags. This allows them to bully their way to
the leadership of hag covens.

Scorpion
Chitinous scourges of deserts, forests, savannas, and badlands, scorpions are
deadly arachnids with powerful pincers and a painful sting. Scorpions can be
found in nearly every climate, where they hunt their prey with a mixture of
patient stealth and raw strength. Most scorpions live in underground burrows,
either as lone hunters or part of a larger colony. These arachnids are so feared and
dangerous that in many cultures, they are treated as deities or dualistic symbols
of both death and protection from said death.
Giant Scorpion
These massive, terrifying arachnids are typically 8 feet long from head to the
base of the tail. Giant scorpions are the favored pack animals and war beasts of
various desert-dwelling monsters, particularly gnolls. They are most commonly
encountered in the wild, however. There they lair in mountainside caves or
burrow beneath shallow layers of sand where they lie in wait for prey to wander
near. Sleek, pallid subterranean scorpions also exist, as do still larger species.

SEA DEVIL “DIPLOMACY”
Sea devils dwell in most of the
world’s oceans, and they view all
others as enemies. When alliances
occur, they usually take place
with singularly powerful allies,
such as aquatic dragons, krakens,
or powerful humanoid villains.
Diplomacy, to a sea devil, typically
consists of violence and warfare.
Sea Devil
Sea devils are horrid, amphibious humanoids who lurk in Golarion’s oceans and
crawl ashore to steal away victims beneath the veil of darkness. When an entire
ﬁshing village disappears overnight, sea devils are the ﬁrst suspects.
Far from mindless monstrosities, sea devils are terribly intelligent, with a cunning
limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. They call themselves “sahuagin”
but have wholly embraced their enemies’ name for their kind as their own. Their
cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of
sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving)
members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline,
however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent
of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to
revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause
a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party. For
this reason, sea devils typically capture landborne quarry using nets and ropes,
dragging them to the depths of the sea before making even a single incision.
Among sea devil society, individuals are rewarded based on their performance
during hunts and shore excursions, with rebels and outliers quickly culled from
the ranks. Every pup is given a fair chance, however, and even the lowest-born
sea devil can strive for the rank of commander, general, or perhaps even king
or queen. Sea devils in positions of leadership tend to be among the largest,
most violent, and most calculating of their kind, and fully realized sea
devils are skilled warriors capable of capturing entire villages on their own.
The most powerful sea devils are mighty kings and queens who coordinate
the activity of lesser sea devils across territories spanning leagues, foiling
attempts at their positions via manufactured blood feuds and wars against
their numerous enemies ashore and underwater.
Sea Devil Scout
Scouts, among the lowliest (and most disposable) of sea devils, ply the inky waters of
the ocean in search of aquatic prey, tread ashore to gauge landborne threats, or charge
into battle with the advance forces of a greater sea devil war party.

MUTANT DEVILS
Sea devils are prone to mutations,
the most common of which is the
manifestation of two additional
arms. These mutated sea devils
almost always rise to power as
barons. Other mutations occur as

those that result in sea devils who

jaws, gains 7 temporary HP until the end of the frenzy, and takes a –2 status penalty to
AC. The sea devil can’t voluntarily stop its frenzy. After its frenzy, the sea devil is fatigued.
Bloodletting When the sea devil deals piercing or slashing damage, it also deals 1d4
persistent bleed damage if the target was ﬂat-footed or if the attack was a critical hit.

Physically imposing sea devils are equipped with some of the best weaponry the
community can ﬁnd, though most are happy to rend their foes using tooth and nail.

SEA SERPENT LAIRS
While an underwater cave will do,
sea serpents prefer to “build” lairs
by sinking ships. A sea serpent
might even create a massive
underwater graveyard by crashing
several ships in the same location
and letting the debris stack up on
the ocean ﬂoor.
Sea Serpent
These fabled beasts resemble massive snakes with long rows of ﬁnned spines down
their back. Temperamental and territorial, sea serpents can capsize a boat with ease,
and most won’t hesitate to do so when hungry or threatened. Stories abound of
aggrieved captains who spend their entire lives hunting down the elusive monster
that sunk their ships and took their livelihoods. These hunts rely on rumors and
glimpses of the beasts, as few survive the catastrophes wrought by sea serpents.
While many ﬁshermen’s tales paint sea serpents as divinely appointed
guardians of the ocean or, alternately, as evil and demonic agents, the truth is
that most sea serpents are simply very large beasts with a knack for avoiding
magical detection.

SHADOW LOCATIONS
Shadows might lurk in any dimly
lit area—a corner in a crumbling
ruin, a room lit by ﬂickering
candles, or a shaded forest at
dusk. They travel to and from the
Shadow Plane, though it is unclear
if they do so via their own magic
or by aligning themselves with a
more powerful being capable of
such planar shifting.
Shadow
The mysterious undead known as shadows lurk in dark places and feed on those
who stray too far from the light. Those who parley with shadows, typically by
keeping them at bay with a glowing weapon, may learn great secrets, for they
are ideal spies.

BECOMING MANEATERS
Contrary to popular belief, sharks
are not particularly fond of
humanoids as meals. Only under
the right conditions—such as
when food is scarce or the shark
mistakes its victim for a seal—will
a shark attack a swimmer or small
boat. Such occasions are traumatic
enough for survivors to perpetuate
the myth of shark as maneater.
Shark
Sharks of all shapes and sizes have stalked the oceans, largely unchanged,
since primordial times. They are efﬁcient, ruthless predators with multiple
rows of razor-sharp teeth capable of rending prey in an instant. Their uncanny
ability to smell blood in the water means sharks might show up at any scene
of aquatic carnage.
Great White Shark
An apex predator among the coastal surface waters where it hunts, the great
white shark is one of the largest shark species. These silent killers glide gracefully

TEKELI-LI
While a shoggoth’s cacophony is
a bewildering and eldritch mix of
sound and dangerous secrets, the
phrase “tekeli-li” is the most oft
repeated cry, and these mysterious
words are always discernible
among their wild vocalizations.
Sometimes, wild birds that dwell in
places haunted by shoggoths seem
to cry out this strange phrase,
while at others it can be heard on
blasts of frozen winds. Attempts
to translate the phrase, even via
magic, have only ever met with
failure, as if the words themselves
actively resist revealing their
secrets to the world.
Shoggoth
Although even raving fanatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the
monstrous shoggoth is nothing more than a drug-induced vision or a thankfully
unreal nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. Shoggoths exist, yet they tend
keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of caverns and ruins,
emerging to spread chaos and destruction in their slimy wakes.
The ﬁrst shoggoths were created by an alien species to serve as mindless beasts
of burden. Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them
useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes,
mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile.
Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their
masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps.
A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They
remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters,
humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl
upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth
rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulﬁng them in a
gelatinous press of ﬂesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring.
Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to
chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be
counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacriﬁce to it.
Rumors of shoggoths that have developed even greater intellects are, one would
hope, just that, for the damage a shoggoth capable of reasoning could wreak upon
a world is unsettling to say the least.

SHULN RESOURCES
Adventurers who fear encounters
with cave worms might seek out a
shuln and attempt to lure it along
or magically compel it to aid in
the ﬁght to come, but the shulnʼs
stubborn personality makes such
eﬀorts diﬃcult and unreliable.
More often, acquiring the shulnʼs
saliva is an easier tactic, although
the poison must be alchemically
preserved if it is to be used as
an injury poison, for this foul-
smelling liquid breaks down
quickly once it drools from the
shuln’s toothy maw.
Shuln
Scourges of the upper Darklands, these enormous, mole-like monstrosities slice
and burrow through solid stone with massive forearms and adamantine-strong
claws. Shulns grow to about 20 feet long and have four tiny, nearly imperceptible
eyes; a long, pale snout; four thick-muscled legs that end in long, serrated claws;
and a stubby pink tail. As a young shuln matures, its unique metabolism produces
adamantine that becomes infused throughout its skeletal system. In addition to
making their claws and fangs nearly unbreakable, this unique physiological trait
makes shulns unparalleled burrowers and highly sought by monster hunters who
hope to harvest the precious material from their corpses.
Shulns have a ravenous appetite and eat nearly anything they can catch, but
their preferred diet consists almost entirely of large invertebrates, especially
cave worms. They rely on tiny sensory whiskers that cover their snout  and
allow them to detect subtle movements in the air and ground without the
use of vision. When it detects suitable prey, a shuln bites the target at the ﬁrst
opportunity, injecting it with a potent paralytic toxin present in its saliva. So
strong is this poison that it is capable of subduing even the near-unstoppable
purple worm, making the shuln a valuable (if dangerous) companion to have
for anyone making excursions into worm-infested regions of the Darklands.
Shulns’ notoriously ill-tempered dispositions and their knack for digging into
areas of an underground settlement where digging ought not occur makes them
frustrating creatures to keep around, but when the alternative is an unpredictable
but deadly visit from an enormous, hungry cave worm, the annoyances are well
worth the trouble.
Encounters with much larger shuln-like entities on the Plane of Earth suggest
that these creatures may have originated from that place. The larger shulns still
retain their elemental qualities, are quite a bit smarter, and have their own suite
of earth-themed innate primal spells—but for all that, they still love the taste of
cave worm.

SERVANTS OF SHELYN
While simurghs can be found in
the service of most good-aligned
faiths, it is the teachings of Shelyn,
goddess of art, to which these
creatures are most often drawn.
A temple of Shelyn that has
managed to attract the attention
and friendship of a simurgh
typically honors the creature’s
privacy and does not boast of the
alliance, yet won’t hesitate to call
for its aid in times of need.
Simurgh
Desert-dwelling people consider the sight of a simurgh a herald to a lifetime’s
worth of luck, and those who are unfamiliar with the majestic beast might
mistake it for the avatar of a deity. Beautiful, graceful, and truly gargantuan,
the simurgh resembles nothing so much as a massive multicolored bird with the
head of an equally enormous and regal lupine. Simurghs act as intermediaries in
world-threatening conﬂicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who
spread their own brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil
extraplanar beings.
Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are
so rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been
aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself
often, but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such
as the incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster.
Simurghs are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can
hardly ﬁnd a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.

BORN OF SIN
Unable to procreate themselves,
sinspawn retreated from the world
for many centuries following the
collapse of the runelords’ empire, but
in recent years they have emerged
from ancient dungeons, strange
magical pools, and other forgotten
ruins. In certain cases, incredibly
powerful artifacts crafted by the
runelords known as runewells
can siphon oﬀ fragments of sinful
memories and emotions related to
the runewells’ associated sins from
the souls of people dying nearby,
fueling the spontaneous creation
of new sinspawn. When enough
sinful energies have been gathered
within a runewell, it vomits forth a
fully grown sinspawn with no prior
loyalty to a long-lost runelord. All
sinspawn inherently understand the
runewells’ role in the propagation of
their kind, and they often establish
small villages near awakened
runewells, hunting down sentient
beings they can use to propagate
their communities.
Sinspawn
Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively as
runelords—each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The ﬁrst
sinspawn was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have
since gone on to inﬂuence ﬂeshwarping practices (see ﬂeshwarp on page 158). It
wasn’t long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the
other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their
own design, today sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious
of their kind.
Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose ﬂesh they were
formed, sinspawn generally appear horriﬁcally emaciated and have unnaturally
long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins
bulge across sinspawn’s bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble
twisted runes, and their ﬂesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated,
bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half
at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-ﬁngered hands and framing
a long, lolling tongue.
Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated
human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated
sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example,
greedspawn’s veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more
wasted than the rest of their kin.
Sinspawn Sins
When a sinspawn is created, it becomes associated with one of the seven sins:
envoy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath. A sinspawn’s sin is determined
by the runewell that spawned it or by its creator’s preferred sin, and cannot be
changed. Each sin grants sinspawn associated with it additional beneﬁts and
abilities beyond those described by the sinspawn stat block, as detailed below.
ENVYSPAWN
An envyspawn has Deception +7 and typically carries a halberd. They tend to be
shorter and thinner than other sinspawn.
Melee Ȱɵ halberd +10 (reach 10 feet, versatile S), Damage 1d10+4 piercing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against an envyspawn’s sinful bite are
enfeebled 2 for 1 minute.
GLUTTONYSPAWN
A gluttonyspawn has Survival +10 and usually carries a scythe. They are obese,
but hardy and strong.
Melee Ȱɵ scythe +10 (deadly d10, trip), Damage 1d10+4 slashing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a gluttonyspawn’s sinful bite
are drained 1.
GReeDSPAWN
A greedspawn has Thievery +9 and typically wields a glaive. They are the tallest
of sinspawn, often 7 feet in height, and with gold-tinged veins.
[one-actionMelee Ȱɵ glaive +10 (deadly d8, forceful, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+4 slashing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a greedspawn’s sinful bite are
clumsy 2 for 1 minute.
LUSTSPAWN
A lustspawn has Diplomacy +7 and usually carries a guisarme. They have
attractive bodies, but hideous faces.
Melee Ȱɵ guisarme +10 (reach 10 feet, trip), Damage 1d10+4 slashing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a lustspawn’s sinful bite are
stupeﬁed 2 for 1 minute.

SINSPAWN LOCATIONS
Sinspawn are found in regions
where sources for their creation
remain buried in ancient ruins—in
Golarion, this currently limits them
to the frontier lands of Varisia.
But as they spread, so to does the
potential knowledge of crafting
more of them, and ﬂeshwarpers
around the world are hoping to
someday soon craft new sinspawn
of their own.
PRIDeSPAWN
A pridespawn has Intimidation +7 and often wields a maul. They are nearly
skeletal in their gauntness, and often seek out ﬁne clothes or jewelry to wear,
taking strange pleasure in appearing elegant and regal.
Melee Ȱɵ maul +10 (shove), Damage 1d12+4 bludgeoning
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a pridespawn’s sinful bite are
clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
SLOTHSPAWN
A slothspawn has Society +6 and usually carries a longspear. Thick rolls of excess
skin drape the slothspawn’s hunched frame.
Melee Ȱɵ longspear +10 (reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+4 piercing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a slothspawn’s sinful bite take
a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.
WRATHSPAWN
The most commonly encountered of the sinspawn, a wrathspawn has
Athletics +12 and typically wields a ranseur. These sinspawn are the
bulkiest looking of their kind.
Melee Ȱɵ ranseur +10 (disarm, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d10+4 piercing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a
wrathspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1 as well as enfeebled
1 for 1 minute.

CREATING SKELETONS
Start with a skeleton of the
appropriate size. (Gargantuan
skeletons can use skeletal hulk with
the elite template, Gargantuan size,
and 5 feet more reach.) Add Strikes,
Speeds, or other abilities it would
gain from its shape. For instance,
a chimera skeleton might have a
horn attack with its goat head and
jaw attacks with its dragon and lion
heads, but not a ﬁst attack.
Skeleton
Made from bones held together by foul necromancy, skeletons are among the most
common types of undead, found haunting old dungeons and forgotten cemeteries.
Skeleton Abilities
Most skeletons have one of these abilities. If you give a skeleton more, you might
want to increase its level and adjust its statistics.
Bloody The skeleton is covered in dripping blood and gains fast healing equal to its level.
Collapse Ǻȓ Trigger The skeleton is critically hit. Eﬀect The skeleton collapses into a
pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a
standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and ﬂat-footed.
Explosive Death When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the
necromantic energy holding it together is released. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing
damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reﬂex save.
Screaming Skull ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The skeleton removes its skull and
throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to Demoralize
each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even ﬂies back, returning
to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is blind until then.
Skeleton Guard
The most common skeletal minions are mere guardians.

UNLIFE WITHOUT FLESH
The necromantic energies that
infuse animated undead skeletons
give them the ability to see
without eyes and move without
muscles. Despite being mindless,
skeletons’ instinct to evil comes
from their corrupt vital essence,

creation rather than destruction.

SKULLTAKER INSIGHT
The cooperation of a skulltaker is
a powerful asset, for this whirling
mass of death knows the collective
memories of the creatures whose
bones form its body. Because
mountain travelers come from
far and wide, the breadth of a
skulltaker’s knowledge is often
vast, spanning a range of topics.
Skulltaker
Swirling down from misty peaks and through howling mountain passes
like an evil wind, the vortex of bones known as a skulltaker is a terrible
manifestation of the delirium and agony experienced by doomed climbers and
lost trailblazers just before they met their end. In some places, a skulltaker is
also known as a saxra.

Skeletal Lore (divination, divine) A skulltaker taps into the memories of the creatures
whose bones make up its body. This gives it the Skeletal Lore skill, which it can use
to Recall Knowledge of any kind. In addition, it can speak and understand all the
languages known by the creatures whose bones make up its body (typically including
Common and the regional language of the skulltakerʼs home region). The skulltaker can
use Skeletal Lore as the primary skill check for the legend lore ritual (Core Rulebook
413), and it can cast legend lore without secondary casters.

Bonetaker (divine, necromancy) Whenever a creature
dies within 60 feet of a skulltaker, the skulltaker
draws a portion of the creature’s bones into its

skeletal champion (page 298) in 1d4 rounds. These skeletal champions
are controlled by the skulltaker.
Energy Drain (divine, necromancy) When a skulltaker hits with a melee
Strike, the target must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or become
drained 2 and doomed 1.
Splintered Ground Ȱɵ The skulltaker causes splintered bones to erupt from all
solid surfaces in a 100-foot emanation, except for surfaces of worked stone.
A creature moving through the bones takes 10 piercing damage and 10 negative
damage for every 5 feet of movement. The ﬁrst time each round a creature takes piercing
damage from these splintered bones, it must succeed at a Reﬂex save or take a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 10 minutes, or a –15-foot circumstance penalty for
24 hours on a critical failure. The bones remain in place until the skulltaker uses this action
again or the bones are manually removed, which takes 10 minutes for each 5-foot square.

SLURK RIDING
A willing or broken slurk can be
used as a mount by a creature at
least one size smaller than the
slurk. A slurk’s back slime grants
its rider a +2 circumstance bonus
against any attempts to physically
dismount the rider.
Slurk
The slurk is a sticky, tusked frog-beast found in underground lairs and caves. It
has two massive tusks, which it uses to gore prey and tangle with rival slurks.
With the slurk’s natural ability to climb walls and cling effortlessly to ceilings, it
can be easy for unwary cave explorers to end up on the wrong end of the beast’s
formidable ivory tusks.
Slurks exude two very different types of foul-smelling secretions from their
pale white skin. Large pustules on the slurk’s back drip a sticky resin-like slime
that quickly hardens upon exposure to air. By ﬂexing its skin, the slurk can
burst these pustules in the direction of intruders, covering its foes in sticky
goo and severely limiting their ability to withstand the monster’s other attacks,
including the effects of its other secretion. Glands along the slurk’s ventral side
excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from
the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added beneﬁt of
making it extremely difﬁcult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover
if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which
accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where the slurk rests
between meals.
Slurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate
and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals. Despite this
apparent failure, slurks are often befriended by others who live underground.
The sticky frog-beasts have proven extremely desirable to kobolds, who now
domesticate and train slurks as powerful mounts and guardians. While other
creatures, particularly boggards, sometimes train slurks to serve as guardians,
kobolds remain those who use these creatures the most. A kobold mounted on
a slurk will often hide in the upper ledges of a cave, using the advantages of
height and surprise to harry foes with ranged attacks. Kobold riders also take
advantage of the slurk’s ability to climb, and charge at their enemies from the
walls of a cavern.

DC to Balance across the slime is 18.

SNAKE RESOURCES
Snakeskin’s distinctive pattern
and wide variety of applications
makes it a sought-after resource,
and the hides of extra-large snakes
such as giant anacondas can fetch
a ﬁne price in the right market.
Such oversized snake hides can be
used to craft clothing of snakeskin
leather, including boots and gloves,
as well as other items such as
scabbards, backpacks, and even
tents or makeshift boats.
A snake’s hide can be cleanly
removed with a successful Crafting
check or appropriate Lore check.
Snake
Snakes come in an array of forms, from jungle-dwelling constrictors that wrap
around their prey to venomous vipers with deadly bites. Regardless, all snakes
consume their prey whole by unhinging their jaws and using powerful muscles to
move the food down their throats and into their stomachs.
Viper
Each member of this family of venomous snakes has long, hinged fangs that inject
potent venom in their prey. Different vipers inject different types of venom, which
might result in paralysis, extreme pain and swelling, blood clotting, or even the
sudden stopping of the victim’s heart.

SPHINX RIDDLES
Sphinxes are well-known for their
love of riddles, a love that often
moves beyond into the realm of
obsession. A would-be foe who can
answer a sphinx’s favorite riddles,
or better yet, can stump the
sphinx with a crafty and creative
riddle of their own, can often avoid
combat with the monster as well
as secure its aid.
Sphinx
Sphinxes are mystical beings with the body of a lion, the wings of a great bird,
and the upper torso and head of a human. They are often maligned in legends as
nothing more than monsters, and though they are quick to anger and are capable
of exacting deadly retribution for perceived slights, they are also very intelligent.
Sphinxes are often associated with desert regions, but they can dwell in more
moderate climates as well. They form small groups consisting of a single, extended
family that hunts and works together to protect and teach their young. As they
mature, sphinxes develop a wanderlust, a drive to gather hidden lore and solve the
world’s greatest riddles—the trait that is perhaps most often identiﬁed with their kind.
While sometimes bound into service as guardians for powerful spellcasters,
lone sphinxes may also be encountered on journeys of discovery and as purveyors
of esoteric lore. If treated with the proper respect—and fed well—a sphinx can
demonstrate a willingness to exchange information. Their favorite currency is,
of course, riddles and secrets. One who can trade knowledge for knowledge has
a much better chance of succeeding while bargaining with a sphinx. However,
a sphinx’s insatiable thirst for new riddles as well their extensive collection of
secrets accumulated over hundreds of years of life—makes it difﬁcult to offer them
something they don’t already know. Those who attempt to trade petty insight and
stale riddles may invoke a sphinx’s ire and will not live long enough to regret it.

casting a heightened glyph of warding spell. The sphinx usually shapes the
glyph to take the form of a written riddle, and sets the password to the
answer. A creature that gives the wrong answer or tries to pass without
answering must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or suﬀer one of
the following spell eﬀects, chosen by the sphinx when
creating the symbol: synaptic pulse (5th), charm
(4th), fear (3rd), phantom pain (3rd), sleep (3rd).
The sphinx learns the identity of any creature
that answers the riddle and tends to be friendly
to them.

ASSOCIATED MONSTERS
Though they are vermin incapable
of forming true alliances, spiders
show up alongside many types
of creatures, including web
lurkers (page 325). Spellcasters
sometimes call upon spiders
using summon animal, and spider
swarms have a way of popping up
just about anywhere at the most
inopportune times.
Spider
Few everyday vermin inspire as much dread as the infamous spider.
Spider Swarm
An abundance of food, the sudden hatching of a clutch of eggs, or magical
inﬂuence can cause smaller spiders to gather in terrifying, deadly masses.
