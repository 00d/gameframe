DIABOLIC LOCATIONS
The nine layers of Hell are the
planar home of all devils, and
they much prefer its tyrannically
ordered environs to anywhere else
in the multiverse. Yet devils can
be encountered anywhere mortals
can be tempted by infernal
bargains or seek diabolic aid. On
Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is
particularly aligned with Hell. Its
government is based upon Hellʼs
organization, and the state church
is that of Asmodeus.
Erinys (Fury Devil)
Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature’s crimes, torturing
and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape
of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the ﬁrst erinyes shared
that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser
devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of
torturers and persecutors. The erinyes’ origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a
fallen angel and one of Hell’s most powerful demigods. The ﬁrst erinyes were all
considered to be Eiseth’s metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that
time are no longer limited to a single gender.

Furious Fusillade ̂ˬ The erinys hovers in place if they are
ﬂying and ﬁres one arrow at any number of creatures in a
30‑foot cone. Each attack is rolled separately. This counts as
one attack for the purpose of the erinys’s multiple attack penalty.
Rope Snare An erinys carries a coil of rope woven of their hair (use
the statistics for rope) that animates in their hands. When a creature is
hit by the erinys’s rope, a segment of the rope tears loose and wraps itself
around the creature, imposing a 10–foot circumstance penalty to Speed. The
piece that tears oﬀ is 10 feet long for a Medium or smaller creature, and doubles in
length for each size larger than Medium. When a creature Escapes the eﬀect (DC 26),
the detached segment of rope withers away into useless black sludge.
Phistophilus (Contract Devil)
Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely found outside
the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential contracts,
tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their worldly
desires. If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts for

INFERNAL CONTRACTS
The infernal contracts created by
contract devils are not the only
ways a devil can engage a mortal in
a binding agreement, but they are
the most convenient. Other devils
must perform complex rituals or
jump through bureaucratic hoops to
organize a contract with a mortal,
and in most cases the easiest
solution for devils in this situation
is to simply enlist the aid of a
contract devil.
prices seemingly lesser than their soul all at once, though in this case, the devil
carefully manipulates the price to drive the signatory toward the forces of
law and evil, and therefore ultimately to Hell anyway. Contract devils are tall
creatures with skin tones that range from bronze to crimson and large curving
horns extending from their bodies, over which they often drape favored or
important contracts.

Rituals DC 31; infernal pact
Draft Contract ̂ˬ (conjuration, divine, manipulate)
The contract devil produces an infernal contract for
a single living mortal. This contract can grant a wide
range of abilities and eﬀects, akin to the power of a
wish spell but fulﬁlled to the letter by the contract
devil. To receive any of those beneﬁts, the mortal must
willingly sign its true name to the contract. At that
point, the mortal’s soul is bound to the contract devil
and Hell.
	 While the contract is in eﬀect, the victim can’t be
restored to life except by wish or similar magic. If
the mortal is restored to life by those means, the
contract devil knows which mortal came to life and
can locate the creature or creatures who restored
the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the eﬀects of a
locate spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms
of an infernal contract is diﬃcult and often dangerous.
Infernal Investment A contract devil can cast a 10th-level innate scrying spell
at will, but only to target a creature with which it has a contract. The target
automatically critically fails its save.
Infernal Wound (divine, necromancy) As barbazu, but the
persistent bleed damage is 3d6, and the counteract DC to
use healing magic is 29.

ELEMENTAL BEINGS
The Elemental Planes—primordial
realms deﬁned by aspects of air,
earth, ﬁre, or water—are home to
a diverse group of beings known
as elementals. Spellcasters on
the Material Plane call upon
elementals for aid, though these
enigmatic creatures can also
travel to the world of mortals via
interplanar gateways and rifts.
The elementals on these pages
exemplify the creatures of the
Elemental Planes, but this list is by
no means exhaustive.

ELEMENTAL LORDS
The most powerful elementals are
demigods known as elemental
lords. Until recently, only four evil
elemental lords ruled over realms
on the Elemental Planes. However,
recent events have allowed the
previously imprisoned good
elemental lords to return to their
realms, causing massive conﬂicts
that could lead to planar wars.

Earth elementals make excellent bodyguards for adventuresome spelunkers and are

CONJURING MEPHITS
Mephits are a favorite target for
low-level spellcasters to summon,
both because they have several
useful abilities and because they
are relatively easy to command
and manipulate. Still, care must
be taken when using mephits as
minions, because if left unwatched
or unattended for too long, they
can cause all sorts of mischief.
Elemental, Mephit
Mephits—sometimes known as elemental scamps—are little bipedal critters
with bat-like wings who serve stronger elementals on the Elemental Planes or
neophyte spellcasters who summon them to the Material Plane. All mephits
have an inkling of magical power as well as a breath weapon.
Air Mephit
Air mephits are capricious and ﬂighty relative to their kin; they are as likely to
ﬂy blindly into battle as they are to whine in terror at a loud noise. They are pale
blue in coloration and have thin wings that trail small puffs of vapor as they ﬂy
through the skies.

that deals 2d6 slashing damage to each creature within the area (DC 17 basic Reﬂex
save). The air mephit can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Earth Mephit
Earth mephits are humorless and trudge about their tasks with little enthusiasm.
They are somewhat more stout than other mephits, and their dark-brown or
gray bodies are always coated with layers of dirt and ﬁlth. An earth mephit
can ﬂy, just as any other mephit, but the act of ﬂight is uncomfortable and
unnerving to them—they rarely ascend higher than 5 feet off the ground if
they can help it.

that deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature within the area (DC 17 basic

Fire Mephit
Fire mephits are conniving and quick to anger. They aren’t evil, but they delight
in inﬂicting pain, and their love of burning things pushes them the closest to this
alignment of all mephits. They have bright-orange skin, and wisps of ﬂame ﬂicker
along their wings as they ﬂap through the air. The rivalry between ﬁre and water
mephits is notorious, and these creatures loathe working together for any amount
of time.

OTHER MEPHITS
The four mephits presented here
are but the most common of
their kind. Others that rise from
the mixing of elemental energies
exist as well: creatures like dust
mephits (who breathe out a
scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits
(who spit out sickening gusts of
frozen air), magma mephits (which
can assume the form of a pool of
lava), ooze mephits (which spit out
foul-smelling acid), salt mephits
(who can draw moisture out of the
environs and nearby creatures),
and steam mephits (which can call
down tiny squalls of boiling rain).

Water Mephit
Water mephits are consummate jokers who are always happy to trade a favor
for a good laugh. Just as ﬁre mephits are the ones who cleave closest to evil
without fully crossing over into true villainy, water mephits are the friendliest
of the mephits and therefore the closest to good. Still, one should take care
in making assumptions about a water mephit’s benevolence, for no one can
reliably count on them to keep their inborn need for pranks and trickery at bay
for long. Water mephits have blue-green skin that shimmers in light like ﬁsh
scales. Though water mephits’ wings look more like webbed ﬁns than limbs
capable of ﬂight, they can ﬂap their wings to ﬂy through the air as easily as any
other mephit. Water mephits prefer to swim, when possible, and they leave the
water only when they must.

ELEPHANT RESOURCES
Elephant tusks are a highly sought-
after treasure, the ivory from a
single tusk potentially fetching
hundreds of gold coins. Those
who value the elephant’s majestic
presence are impassioned defenders
of the creatures, making the
hunt for ivory dangerous.
Elephant
Immediately recognizable by their long, prehensile trunks and impressive tusks,
elephants have different characteristics depending on where they are found.
Elephants are used as beasts of burden in many regions, but they are extremely
clever and must be handled with great care.
Elephant
Those who live near elephants have learned to be wary of angering the beasts,
but even with precautions in place, elephants sometimes still rampage. There
is little an individual person can do when even a single elephant becomes
enraged. Furthermore, a herd of angry or frightened elephants can easily
destroy an entire village.

LOSING A HEAD
An ettin who loses one of its heads
is a sorry sight indeed. Rather than
clean and cauterize the stump, an
ettin will typically leave as much
of its decapitated head attached as
possible, even possibly attempting
to sew a completely severed head
back on or keep it in a knapsack
strung around its shoulder.
Ettin
Two heads aren’t always better than one. The slovenly, violent giants known as
ettins are proof enough of that.
The origin of these two-headed brutes is unknown, but few who encounter
ettins ponder their beginnings for long. Rather, the ﬁrst priority for most creatures
during such a confrontation is escape, which is not easy to accomplish given the
ettins’ notorious vigilance. In this way, two heads are better than one—ettins
regularly ﬁnd employ in the ranks of giant or orc armies as sentries and guards.
The beneﬁts of an ettin security detail are obvious: because it has a shared
stomach, an ettin requires only the same amount of food as one typical ogre,
yet its two sets of eyes make it twice as observant. An ettin never complains for
lack of company, either. The ettin’s two heads are uniquely content to squabble
and converse between themselves, and though they bicker incessantly, most
couldn’t dream of life without the other. Much like some twins, an ettin has
two individual minds who nonetheless consider the other as much a part of
their life as their own self.
Ettins do not resemble a single giant heritage so much as an amalgamation
of several. Their tusks are thought to stem from orc ancestry, though their size
and dimness suggest hill giant blood. Though they tower over goblins
and hobgoblins, ettins are more than at home among tribes of these
creatures and enjoy their comfortable stations as camp lookouts
or troop rearguards. Their exposure to a wide variety of
goblinoids and giants is evident in their language; ettins
speak a pidgin tongue of Goblin, Jotun, and Orcish,
and their diction is mostly good enough to get across
the general meaning of their short sentences and
bumbled sayings—although most interlocutors
simply nod their heads while conversing
with an ettin anyway. The monsters are
notoriously short tempered and, despite their
heightened visual perception, short sighted in
matters of keeping their allies alive.

Independent Brains Each of an ettin’s heads rolls its own
initiative and has its own turn. Neither head can Delay. At
the start of a head’s turn, that head gets 2 actions and 1
reaction. Each brain controls one of the ettin’s arms, but
both can move the legs. Any ability that would sever
an ettin’s head (such as the vorpal weapon property)
doesn’t cause the ettin to die if it still has its other
head, but does cause it to lose the turns, actions,
and reactions of the severed head. Mental eﬀects
that target a single creature aﬀect only one of
the ettin’s heads.

FAERIE DRAGON
TREASURE
Faerie dragon hide can be made
into armor for a Small creature.
They sometimes wear magical
amulets or rings.
FAERIE DRAGON LAIRS
Faerie dragons live in old forests or
places where the veil between the
First World and the Material Plane
is thinnest. They often decorate
their lairs with sparkly trinkets or
groom the surrounding foliage into
pleasing shapes.
Faerie Dragon
Although they are much smaller than their larger dragon cousins, faerie dragons
have the many of the same physiological attributes, including long necks, toothy
maws, sinuous tails, and sharp claws. They ﬂit about on iridescent butterﬂy wings,
the coloring of which changes based on where they live, giving them a natural
camouﬂage. Unlike their larger kin, an adult faerie dragon remains the same size
throughout its lifespan. The only visual clue to the age of a faerie dragon is the
sheen on its scales, a glimmer that becomes more lustrous the older it gets.
Faerie dragons usually exhibit pleasant and good-natured temperaments,
though they have a mischievous streak that leads them to play tricks on those
around them. In search of an amusement, they prefer harmless annoyances to
wounding malice. While often spontaneous, they may also spend months if not
years planning the perfect prank. Especially responsive targets endear themselves
to faerie dragons and may create a lifelong bond. A faerie dragon’s reputation as
a trickster leads many to associate them with fey, with whom the tiny dragons
have cordial relationships.
Peaceful by nature, faerie dragons do not enjoy confrontation. If faced with
hostility, they prefer to remain at a distance and breathe euphoric gas at their foes,
diffusing the skirmish by creating an atmosphere of bliss. If conﬂict escalates,
they target their opponents with spells, using their renowned trickery to escape.
If their companions are in danger, however, their desire to remain out of combat
changes. Faerie dragons protect their friends by any means available, including
physical combat.
Sometimes as faerie dragons grow older, their connection to the First World
grows stronger. In addition to growing more lustrous and vibrant in appearance,
these faerie dragons gain an increasing amount of magical primal power. Such
faerie dragons increase in strength as appropriate—a faerie dragon of
20th level or even higher is possible, but it is exceptionally unusual
to encounter a faerie dragon of 9th level or higher beyond the
most remote regions of the First World. When creating a more
powerful faerie dragon, change its tradition to primal and
grant it a number of primal spells known appropriate
for a druid of its level. Faerie dragons don’t grow
much larger, regardless of how powerful they
become. Those who would seek to torment or vex
a faerie dragon would do well to consider this, as
it’s often difﬁcult to tell how powerful one of these
tiny dragons truly is at a simple glance!

Marid
Marids are capricious but powerful genies from the Plane of Water; among
geniekind, they are rivaled in power only by the ﬁery efreet. Marids embody
the strength of the ocean’s waves and currents, but they also have a gentler side,
loving performance and art such as dancing, music, and storytelling.
Marids regard efreet with hostility but rarely encounter them in their native
environment. They get along with djinn, jann, and shaitans, although the
latter consider marids ﬂighty and annoying, associating only long enough to
close trade deals. Marid society has strict rules of hospitality, and many marid
cities have a magically sealed foreign quarter where marid shahzadas conduct
business with air-breathers.
