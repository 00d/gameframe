Change Shape Ȳ˓ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) Once per round, a veiled
master can take on the appearance of a humanoid of Large, Medium, or Small size or
resume its true form. While in humanoid form, the veiled master’s Speed is 30 feet, and it
loses its mucus cloud aura and swim Speed.
If the humanoid form assumed lacks
the aquatic trait, the veiled master
loses its own aquatic trait as well. In
humanoid form, the veiled master can
use weapons, or it can make Strikes
that work like its tentacle attack but
use the reach of its current form. If
the assumed form has fangs or claws,
the veiled master can also make such
Strikes, but these attacks lack the veiled master’s slime.
Consume Memories (mental, occult) When a veiled
master makes a fangs Strike against a creature,
it can consume some of that creature’s memories. The target must succeed at a
DC 37 Fortitude saving throw or become stupeﬁed 1. A veiled master regains 5
Hit Points each time it successfully consumes memories. When
a veiled master consumes memories, it learns some of the
creature’s memories (subject to the GM’s discretion).
Delayed Suggestion (enchantment, occult) When a veiled master
successfully casts dominate on a creature, a suggestion
spell triggers when the dominate spell ends. This suggestion
usually causes the target to return to the veiled master, so
the creature can cast dominate again, but a veiled master can
set the suggestion to diﬀerent orders if it wishes.
Slime (curse, occult, virulent) As alghollthu master, but DC 36.
Tentacle Flurry ʚʖ The veiled master thrashes about with its tentacles. Make
a tentacle Strike against each creature within its reach. Roll only one attack
roll, and roll the damage only once for all targets.
Thoughtlance (curse, enchantment, occult) A creature touched by the
veiled master’s tentacles, whether those tentacles deal damage or not,
must attempt a DC 34 Will save, becoming slowed 1 on a failure or
slowed 2 on a critical failure. Each time the aﬀected creature ends its
turn, its slowed value decreases by 1.
OTHER ALGHOLLTHUS
While the veiled masters are the
rulers of alghollthu society, they are
not the most powerful of their kind.
Greater, more mysterious creatures
that function as organic thought
networks, immense aquatic engines
of war, or specialized extractors
of forgotten secrets dwell among
their sunken cities. Meanwhile,
the world above remains infested
with creatures that were originally
created by the alghollthus but have
long since drifted away from their
aquatic progenitors to become their
own sinister monstrosities.

Angel
The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs
based on their abilities and purviews. The majority of angels are neutral good and
live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. However, some angels,
including several angelic deities, have different alignments, and some even dwell
on other planes. Regardless of alignment, angels remain benevolent messengers
possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.
Cassisian (Archive Angel)
The weakest of angels, cassisians usually serve as lackey messengers for more
powerful angels or as spiritual guides for mortals. Despite their limited intellect,
cassisians have a knack for precise recollection, particularly with scripture. Most
cassisians are formed from the souls of trustworthy mortals, but some arise from
fragments of greater angels destroyed in service to the celestial realms.

Transfer Protection A non-evil creature can wear a
willing cassisian as a helmet. While it does, the cassisian
can take no actions, but the cassisian extends its +1
status bonus to AC and saves against evil creatures to its
wearer. At any time, the cassisian can detach itself from
its wearer as an action.

(at will, evil only), heal; Cantrips (1st) know direction, light
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation)
A cassisian can take the appearance of a dove, a winged humanoid,
a dog, or a ﬁsh. Normally, this doesn’t change its Speed or the attack
and damage bonuses for its Strikes, but it might change the damage
type Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). Any further changes for
speciﬁc forms are noted below.
•	 Dog size Small; scent (imprecise) 30 feet, Speed 40 feet; Melee jaws +7,
Damage 1d6+2 piercing plus Knockdown
•	 Fish swim Speed 30 feet
Eye Beams ʚʖ (concentrate, divine, evocation) The cassisian releases beams of heat
or cold from its eyes, dealing 2d6 cold or ﬁre damage (DC 17 basic Reﬂex save) to all
creatures in a 15-foot line. It can’t use Eye Beams again for 1d4 rounds.
Repository of Lore While the cassisian isn’t particularly intelligent, it has perfect memory
and can remember everything it sees or hears. This allows it to attempt Lore checks
on any topic, provided (at the GM’s discretion) the cassisian has encountered the topic
in question before. The cassisian’s limited intellect often prevents it from acting upon
its knowledge, making it a better resource than agent in matters of information use.
Choral (Choir Angel)
Choral angels are incredible singers who ﬁll the halls of Nirvana with pious
chants and sacred hymns. They form from the souls of talented bards and other
performers. While they shy away from conﬂict, they occasionally brave the mortal
ANGELIC DIVINITIES
The most powerful angels belong
to a category of demigods known
as the empyreal lords—a title
shared with other powerful
good-aligned demigods among
the host of archons, azatas, and
other inhabitants of the celestial
planes. The most powerful and
most well-known of the angelic
empyreal lords is Sarenrae.

DEMONIC POSSESSION
Some demons specialize in the art
of possessing creatures or objects
to spread fear and chaos. In such
cases a demon gains a powerful
disguise with which to work its
evils upon the world, a subterfuge
that delights the demon.
in that case, the eﬀect occurs after the last vrock uses Dance of Ruin or one of the
vrocks chooses to complete that round of the dance. Each non-demon creature in a
20-foot emanation from any of the dancing vrocks takes 2d12 electricity damage
(DC 28 basic Reﬂex save). For each additional vrock that joins the dance, the damage
increases by 1d12 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four vrocks dealing
5d12 damage with a DC 31 save). The vrocks can continue dancing by using Dance of
Ruin each round, for up to 3 rounds in total. The emanation’s size increases by 20 feet
each round, and the damage increases by 1d12 per vrock each round.
Spore Cloud Ȱɵ (disease, poison) The vrock emits a cloud of spores from their body,
dealing 2d8 poison damage to all adjacent creatures. Each creature damaged this way
must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 2d8 persistent piercing damage as the
spores penetrate its skin and grow into thick, green vines. The vines cease growing
after 10 rounds, and they wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved oﬀ before then. The
vines can be destroyed if the creature is aﬀected by a good spell or if holy water is
applied to the vines (with an Interact action). Once the vrock uses Spore Cloud, the
ability can’t be used for 1d6 rounds.
Stunning Screech Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, incapacitation, sonic) Frequency once per minute.
Eﬀect The vrock emits a shrill screech. Each non-demon creature within a 30-foot
burst must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is stunned 2,
and on a critical failure, it’s stunned 3.
Glabrezu (Treachery Demon)
Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting
mortal desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as
easily as they breathe. Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to
fruition in the most destructive way possible, turning a wish or hope
into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although the long-term
repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a
struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only
to ﬁnd that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the
weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted
in the form of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus
are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal’s needs.
These massive demons have enormous pincers and
a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their
chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess
formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the
souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.

Truth Vulnerability A glabrezu’s lies sustain them, and the truth can destroy them.
Whenever a revelation eﬀect counteracts or reveals the glabrezu’s illusions or the
glabrezu fails a save against an eﬀect that would prevent them from lying (such as zone
of truth), the demon takes 3d6 mental damage. They take this damage only once
per eﬀect, even if the eﬀect reveals multiple illusions or prevents multiple lies.

DINOSAUR RESOURCES
As animals, dinosaurs have little
interest in treasure (although
velociraptors and deinonychuses,
like their bird cousins, enjoy
keeping sparkling baubles in
their nests), but the remains of
adventurers strewn about their
lairs often still have valuable gear.
Dinosaurs can also be harvested
for rare and valuable trophies such
as teeth, talons, armor plates, and
the like.

Predator’s Advantage Bleeding creatures are ﬂat-footed to the deinonychus.
Ankylosaurus
Squat, heavily armored quadrupeds, ankylosauruses are stubborn and irascible.
Although they’re herbivores, they have been known to attack other creatures that
trespass within territory simply out of ill temper.
Ankylosauruses have few natural predators, as their bony hides are covered in
spiked nubs that jut in many different directions to discourage larger creatures
from biting them. They have mighty tails ending in an immense knot of bone,
which they use to whip at threats with incredible speed and power. While these
low-to-the-ground dinosaurs can trample human-sized or smaller foes, their
relatively squat stance prevents them from doing so against larger targets. An
ankylosaurus is about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs over
3 tons.
The ankylosaurus is the largest of the heavily armored dinosaurs called
ankylosaurids, but smaller versions exist as well. Still Large in size, these smaller
dinosaurs, such as the 16-foot long pinacosaurus, lack the trample ability and
are rarely above 4th level. Regardless of size, ankylosaurids tend to be relatively
muted in coloration, with mixes of black, brown, and gray. When captive, an
ankylosaurus’s keeper might paint its scales bright colors to signify to others
that is not a wild creature.

BORN FROM CHAOS
The Maelstrom, home of all
proteans, is the whirling mass
of turbulent primal energy,
planar waves, and soul-stuﬀ
that surrounds the Outer Planes.
Planar scholars theorize that all of
reality was originally formed from
the Maelstrom in the early days
of the cosmos—a theory proteans
don’t necessarily dispute.
Languages Abyssal, Protean
Skills Acrobatics +7, Deception +6, Religion +4, Stealth +7
Str –1, Dex +4, Con +0, Int –1, Wis –1, Cha +1
Entropy Sense (divination, divine, prediction) A voidworm can anticipate the most likely
presence of a creature through a supernatural insight into chaotic probabilities and
chance. This grants it the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature
under the eﬀects of nondetection or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and
predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense.
AC 17; Fort +5, Ref +9, Will +6
HP 16, fast healing 1; Resistances precision 3, protean anatomy 5
Protean Anatomy (divine, transmutation) A voidworm’s vital organs shift and change
shape and position constantly. Immediately after the voidworm takes acid, electricity,
or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts
for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in
which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes ﬁrst.
The voidworm is immune to polymorph eﬀects unless it is a willing target. If blinded
or deafened, the voidworm automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new
sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.
Speed 20 feet, ﬂy 40 feet; freedom of movement
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +9 (chaotic, ﬁnesse, magical), Damage
1d8–1 piercing plus 1d4 chaotic
Melee Ȱɵ tail +9 (chaotic, ﬁnesse, magical), Damage 1d4–1
slashing plus 1d4 chaotic and confounding lash
Divine Innate Spells DC 16; 4th read omens; 2nd blur (self only),
obscuring mist; 1st detect alignment (at will; lawful only); Cantrips (4th)
dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation; Constant (4th) freedom of movement
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentration, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The voidworm takes
on the appearance of a Tiny animal. This doesn’t change its Speed or its attack and
damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its
Strikes deal.
Confounding Lash (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) A
creature hit by the voidworm’s tail Strike is stupeﬁed 1 for 1
round (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical hit). A successful DC 16 Will
save negates this eﬀect and grants temporary immunity
to confounding lash for 1 minute.
Naunet
Pugnacious and powerfully muscled, naunets serve
as scouts and rank-and-ﬁle troops of protean armies.
Resembling a thick salamander with a wide head, a powerful tail, and
tentacles tipped with snapping jaws in place of rear legs, naunets are the
most bestial of the proteans and occupy one of their lowest castes. Naunets
are 12 feet long and weigh 900 pounds.
All proteans are prone to unpredictable ﬁts and unexpected action, but
compared to most others, naunets are much more bestial. Always ready
for a ﬁght, naunets pride themselves in acting swiftly and striking
before unpleasant distractions like diplomacy can blunt a
combat’s beginning.

NON-EVIL VAMPIRES
Non-evil vampires are rare and
at odds with their basic nature.
Such vampires typically give up a

WARG LEGENDS
Wargs are the subject of many
grim tales and campﬁre stories.
Frightening accounts of wargs
gobbling up children whole have a
disturbing basis in fact, for these
ravenous creatures have jaws that
can unhinge like those of a serpent
to gulp down small prey while the
victim yet lives.
Warg
The warg is an intelligent and malevolent wolf that dwells among goblins,
hobgoblins, orcs, and other violent humanoids.
Warg
Wargs hunt in packs and surround their prey like common wolves, but their
cunning and penchant for taunting victims makes them easy to distinguish from
their less-intelligent cousins. But despite their intelligence, wargs have simple
desires for food and shelter, making them easy for evil humanoids such as orcs
and hobgoblins to recruit to protect their camps or join them in battle. Most
wargs are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are
more than willing to integrate goblinoid ﬂesh into their diet.

Winter Wolf
Winter wolves are related to wargs, but are larger, smarter, and far
more dangerous. They are capable of exhaling plumes of freezing
breath and are big enough to easily serve as mounts for orcs and
hobgoblins—provided the winter wolf is willing, of course. Like
wargs, winter wolves hunt in packs, but unlike their smaller cousins,
they have a notable proud streak. When they deign to serve others, they
reserve this privilege for larger and more dangerous creatures such as
frost giants, renegade yetis, or even white dragons.
