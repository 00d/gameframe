Arboreal
Arboreals are guardians of the forest and representatives of the trees. As longlived as the woods they watch over, arboreals consider themselves parents and
shepherds of trees rather than their gardeners. Consequently, while arboreals
tend to be slow and methodical, they are terrifyingly swift when forced to ﬁght
in defense of the woods. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of
short-lived folk—even elves are fugacious in the eyes of arboreals—and have
an inherent distrust of change, arboreals have been known to tolerate those
who seek to learn from their long-winded, rambling monologues, especially
if such pupils also express a desire to protect the timberlands. Against those
who threaten their realm, such as loggers eager to harvest lumber or settlers
aiming to establish croplands or a town, arboreals’ wrath is unwavering and
devastating. Perhaps ironically, arboreals are gifted at tearing down what others
build—a trait that serves vengeful members of their kind well.
Arboreal Warden
Arboreal wardens are the rangers of arboreal society. These itinerant
folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they
dwell, and rarely stop to take root and rest in the same part of
the forest twice. This wanderlust makes wardens ideal forest
patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants, they
know better than to confront dangerous foes on their
own. Instead, they report any dangers to arboreal
regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal
wardens congregate to form a copse. Copses travel
beyond the boundaries of a forest to investigate the
hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats
before returning to report their ﬁndings. Arboreal
wardens do not pretend to understand to other
creatures’ motives—like most forces of the natural
world, they are ambivalent about mortal affairs that do
not involve their forest.

Marilith (Pride Demon)
Mariliths are the generals of the Abyss, formed from the souls of proud evil
mortals, often warlords and despots. They appear as tall and powerfully built
humans from the waist up with snake tails and six arms. Because of Lamashtu’s
prominence over other demonic deities, most pride demons encountered by
mortals take female form, but they can be of any gender.
Mariliths are among the greatest tacticians in the Abyss, and they have an
almost supernatural knack for understanding the ripples of chaos and the
unpredictable nature of demonic life. Their ability to command armies rises as
much from their commanding presence as it does their ability to read into the
potential results of any possible act and a sufﬁcient understanding of the ﬂow of
entropy to allow them to predict likely outcomes.

Bladestorm ʚʖ The marilith makes up to six longsword Strikes,

marilith’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty
doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
Defensive Assault ʚʖ The marilith makes two Strikes, each with a
diﬀerent weapon, and they use the remaining weapons for protection.
The demon gains a circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round equal to
the number of weapons not used for attacks. If the marilith
later uses any of those weapons to attack (including for an
Attack of Opportunity), the bonus to AC decreases by 1 for
each weapon used.
Focused Assault ʚʖ The marilith attacks a single target
with all the weapons they wield in their arms, overwhelming
the target with multiple attacks and leaving almost nowhere to dodge.
The demon makes a longsword Strike. On a successful attack, the marilith
deals longsword damage to the target, plus an additional 1d8 damage for every
longsword they wield beyond the ﬁrst (typically 5d8 extra damage).
Even on a failed attack, the marilith deals the damage from one
longsword to the target, though they still miss completely
on a critical failure. This counts toward the marilith’s
multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal
to the number of longswords the pride demon wields.

Balor (Fire Demon)
When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most
envision is the balor—a towering ﬁgure of ﬁre and ﬂesh, a horned
nightmare armed with a ﬂaming whip and a sword ﬂying through the
night in search of its latest victim. On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as
generals or captains, and they typically command vast legions of demons. Standing
at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest mortal souls—those who devoted entire lives to
sins too numerous to count—can fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor
forms from a mass of dozens of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life.
BALOR LORDS
Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to
eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent
DEMONIC SOURCES
When a sinful mortal soul is
consigned to the Abyss, it spends
time wallowing in the mire and
feeding on ﬁlth. If it survives
and is not itself eaten, the soul
eventually ascends into a demon,
as inﬂuenced by the nature of
its sin, yet most demons
are themselves capable
of reproduction as well. The
fecundity of demonic life is
perhaps the greatest—and most
threatening—aspect of these
dangerous ﬁends.

OTHER DEMONS
The Abyss may be the largest of
the Outer Planes, and mortals
have an equally large capacity to
betray themselves, society, and the
natural order of reality. With this
limitless source for increasingly
specialized sins, the Abyss is
constantly generating new types of
demons to plague reality. While the
vast majority of these are swiftly
destroyed and never rise again,
enough survive that dozens, if
not hundreds, of types of demons
are known to exist beyond those
listed here. The shadowy invidiak
is a demon without a body, born
of envious souls. The goat-faced,
ﬂame-hooved brimorak rises
from the souls of arsonists. Slimy,
horned blood demons spawn from
assassins, boar demons from the
greedy... the list goes on and on.
demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in
power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further
develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the
role of a true demon lord.

ETHER SPIDER FOES
The Ethereal Plane is a sparsely
populated realm in comparison
to most, used more for traveling
than dwelling. Yet the deep mists
here conceal denizens such as
monstrous parasitic beings that
use humanoids as incubators for
eggs and ﬁends born from the
raw fears of mortal life, and ether
spiders are ever vigilant against
those foes’ machinations.
Ether Spider
Ether spiders are deadly predators from the Ethereal Plane resembling giant
arachnids. Rather than building webs of silk, ether spiders shape the raw
essence of the Ethereal Plane, weaving it in complex patterns that drift through
the misty void. From these ethereal nests, whole families of ether spiders can
scout the adjacent Material Plane, watching for easy prey in dark or remote
corners of the land of mortals. Once an ether spider has spotted a meal, it
anchors its nest and waits on the Ethereal Plane for its prey to draw near. As
soon as its victim is within reach, the ether spider shifts to the Material Plane,
clamps its fangs onto its prey, then shifts back to the Ethereal Plane to wait as
its venom works through the creature’s system. Ether spiders move between
the planes with ease, making them extremely dangerous to those who cannot
see or attack ethereal enemies.
Ether spiders are not mindless or evil—they are simply hungry. If a prospective
meal can sate an ether spider’s incredible appetite through other means, they
might be able to bargain for their life. Ether spiders are especially interested in
items, information, or allies who can help them against their enemies.
As many as half a dozen ether spiders might dwell in the same ether web.
Although ether spiders enjoy one another’s company, they don’t form the same
bonds as most humanoids, and they are more likely to feast on the
corpse of a fallen sibling than save one from certain doom.
Ether spiders dwell in vast nests adrift in the Ghost World,
where they are more likely to let down their guard. Travelers who
ﬁnd a ﬂoating ether spider commune should have an easier time of
making peaceful contact to trade with or even befriend these strange
arachnids. The nests drift on metaphysical currents and are rarely
seen in the same vicinity twice. Sometimes a point of interest on the
neighboring Material Plane compels them to tether their nest to an area,
creating a semipermanent home, and those who learn its location can
return to it repeatedly.

Marids are capricious but powerful genies from the Plane of Water; among

loving performance and art such as dancing, music, and storytelling.
Marids regard efreet with hostility but rarely encounter them in their native
environment. They get along with djinn, jann, and shaitans, although the
latter consider marids ﬂighty and annoying, associating only long enough to
close trade deals. Marid society has strict rules of hospitality, and many marid
cities have a magically sealed foreign quarter where marid shahzadas conduct
business with air-breathers.

CUSTOM GHOSTS
Ghosts work best in adventures
when used sparingly. As they are
remnants of a past life and retain
their intelligence, ghosts can
convey long-lost information or
serve as a way to inform the PCs
of crucial story elements. In this
way, a ghost in an adventure can
provide a clue or even a complete
history of a site or event. Unlike
most other undead, ghosts can
retain the alignment they had in
life, but regardless they should
remain tragic and frightening
ﬁgures in play.
Ghost
When some mortals die through tragic circumstances or without closure, they can
linger on in the world. These anguished souls haunt a locale signiﬁcant to them in
life, constantly trying to right their perceived wrong or wrongdoings.
Creating a Ghost
While it’s best to create custom ghosts to ﬁll an adventure’s speciﬁc needs, you
can also use the following guidelines to turn existing living creatures into ghosts.
First, increase the creature’s level by 2 and change its statistics as follows.
• Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modiﬁers by 2. Increase
the most appropriate melee attack modiﬁer by 4 to become ghostly hand
(described below), and other attack modiﬁers by 2.
• A ghost has a Strength modiﬁer of –5 and a Constitution modiﬁer of +0.
• Do not modify the ghost’s Hit Points due to its new level.
GHOST ABILITIES
A ghost gains the incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become evil. If the
base creature has any abilities or traits that come from it being a living, corporeal
creature, it loses them. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conﬂict
with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities.
Darkvision
Site Bound A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the
place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room,
building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location.
Negative Healing
Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days
within the location it’s bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed
only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever
prevents the spirit from resting.
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious
Resistances all damage 5 (except force, ghost touch, or positive; double resistance to
non-magical). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level.
Fly Speed equal to its Speed
Ghostly Hand All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals negative
damage. It typically has the agile, ﬁnesse, and magical traits. Some ghosts wield
ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the eﬀect is the same.
SPECIaL ABILITIES
Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is
9th level or higher. These abilities should relate to the ghost’s death or its history.
You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes to ﬁt the
theme. For DCs, use 2 + the DC of the ghost’s level (Core Rulebook 503).
Corrupting Gaze ʚʖ The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target
takes 1d6 negative damage + 1d6 per 2 levels with a basic Will save. A creature that
fails its save is also stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute.
Draining Touch ʚʖ With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creatureʼs life
force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target
becomes drained 1 for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level.
Frightful Moan ʚʖ (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) The ghost
laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save.
On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure).
On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost’s frightful moan for
1 minute.
Inhabit Object Ȱɵ The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet,
making it an animated object (pages 20–21). This animated object’s level can be no
higher than the ghost’s level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the
bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when

BUILDING GHOSTS
Note that the ghost mage is built
from the ground up, rather than by
applying the ghost rules to a onceliving creature, so its numbers
don’t exactly match the values
listed above. This is usually the
better way to go if you have the
time, as it allows you to hand-craft
a ghost for the situation.
the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the
object’s square and can’t Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.
Malevolent Possession ʚʖ The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal
creature. This has the same eﬀect as the possession spell, except since the ghost
doesn’t have a physical body, it is unaﬀected by that restriction of the spell.
Telekinetic Assault ʚʖ (divine, evocation) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as
small objects and debris ﬂy about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take
1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels, subject to a basic Reﬂex save.
Ghost commoner
The ghost commoner is an ordinary person who believes they died unjustly,
usually due to foul play or betrayal.

# MANTICORE
================================================================================


Bestiary
MANTICORE TREASURE
A manticore enjoys taking plunder
from the corpses of its prey as
trophies that ﬂatter its vanity and
testify to its strength. It has little
interest in money, but sometimes
accepts gold and jewels as tribute.
Manticore
The manticore is a monstrous amalgamation of lion, dragon, and human with a
penchant for feasting on human ﬂesh. Its distinctive tail is festooned with large
quills like those of a porcupine, which the manticore ﬂings at prey by whipping
its tail like a sling. These deadly spikes give the manticore the power to slaughter
even well-armed warriors from the safety of the sky.
Although the anthropomorphic face of the manticore suggests a keen intellect,
most creatures of its kind are simple-minded killers. They can be clever liars,
however, and their voices have a strangely musical sound that has lured many
unwitting travelers into an ambush. A manticore discovered by uneducated
humanoids (especially those who are both lawful and evil) can sometimes become
the center of adoration and even worship; a manticore in this situation swiftly
gives in to its laziness and allows its acolytes to bring it tribute in the form of
food and treasure, feasting upon its own followers when offerings become scarce.
Stronger humanoids who encounter a manticore can cow it through intimidation
and violence, sometimes even forcing it into service as a mount. As long as the
manticore is well fed with human ﬂesh and its master leads it to victory, a manticore
mount can prove surprisingly loyal.

ﬂings up to two spikes from its
tail, targeting either two diﬀerent
creatures or a single creature. If
the manticore targets two diﬀerent
creatures, these creatures must be
within 20 feet of one another, and
the manticore makes a separate
Strike against each; this counts as
only one Strike for the manticore’s
multiple attack penalty, and the
penalty doesn’t increase until after
both attacks. If the manticore ﬁres
both spikes at the same creature, it
makes a single Strike. If the attack hits, it
deals the damage of a single spike, but the target
is pinned in place, rendering it immobilized. A
creature that succeeds at a DC 23 Athletics
check (attempted as a single action) can
pull the spike free.
A manticore can hurl no more than 12
spikes in 24 hours.

widespread, medusas resembling
humans of every major ethnicity can
be found in Avistan and Garund.
Medusa
Monstrous humanoids that resemble humans with snakes instead of hair,
medusas are best known for their petrifying gazes that—if lingered upon—can
permanently transform mortals to stone. Medusas are shrewd and manipulative
adversaries who collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to
exploit the fears of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic
items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden
power, or inﬁltrate a society to beguile inﬂuential politicians. Their ability to
worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of
criminal outﬁts and thieves’ guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena
leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers ﬁnd what
they seek—for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufﬁcient, a
medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little
more than a glare.
Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from
a conﬂict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves
readied to resist the effects of a medusa’s gaze have nevertheless fallen to a
medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their
foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may
barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried
by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the
monster’s life.

petrifying gaze before attempting its save, a failed save causes it to be
petriﬁed permanently. After attempting its save, the creature is then
temporarily immune until the start of the medusa's next turn.

MERFOLK’S SECRET
Some sailors claim that merfolk
face a grave threat—a dark
and sinister power capable of
rendering even the most beautiful
merfolk into a degenerate and
mutated wretch. Such stories
often end with claims that the
merfolk, proud and noble as they
seem, are unwitting puppets to
some unknown entity lurking
in the deepest depths of the
seas. Merfolk themselves are
characteristically tight-lipped
about such claims.
Merfolk
Elegant, mysterious, and graceful; all this and more can be said of the merfolk.
These enigmatic people resemble humanoids with delicate features from the waist
up but with the ﬁns and tail of a massive ﬁsh from the waist down. Found in
nearly all of Golarion’s oceans, merfolk are as varied in appearance as humans,
their skin ranging from pale to umber and all shades in between, while their
gleaming scales shimmer with the majesty of the sea.
Merfolk Warrior
Merfolk warriors form the bulk of the militias of their vast underwater realms
and meet potential aggressors head-on with uncompromising force.

CREATIVE MIMICS
The older the mimic, the more
creative its guise, but within
practical limits. For example, a
mimic can appear as a neatly
organized bookshelf with a single
book out of place, a dried-up
cistern with something glittering
at its center, or an inconspicuous
wooden door with a conveniently
placed peephole.
Mimic
Thought to be the result of a failed experiment meant to animate objects or a
sinister alghollthu creation, mimics are clever monsters that can take the form
of common manufactured objects. Mimics are ambush predators and voracious
eaters, surprising their prey through their uncanny ability to mimic the form
of common furniture and miscellany. They remain disguised until unsuspecting
adventurers happen by, then they lash out in ambush.
Mimics possess complex alien minds, and while often cruel and self-serving,
they also enjoy conversation with their prey from time to time. For unknown
reasons, they are especially interested in humanoids. Mimics have a strong dislike
for others of their kind and tend to live alone. A mimic can remain in its alternate
form for an extremely long period of time, sometimes remaining disguised in a
dungeon chamber for decades. Regardless of how long
it waits, the mimic remains vigilant and alert, ready to
strike at any moment.

VARIANT MINOTAURS
Most minotaurs are a simple
blend of muscular humanoid and
raging bull, but unusual variants
and unique minotaurs may have
diﬀerent physical features and
abilities. Great-horned minotaurs
can impale foes if they critically
succeed on a charge, but they do
not have the Hunted Fear ability.
Shaggy minotaurs are covered
in thick hair form head to toe,
allowing them to live in freezing
environments with ease and giving
them resistance to cold damage,
but their hooves are broad and
heavy, making it impossible for
them to charge.
Minotaur
Minotaurs are master hunters that dwell in cunning labyrinths or tangles of
underground caverns meant to disorient and demoralize prey. These monstrous
tormentors delight in the hunt, in the terror caused by closing in on prey, and in
the very moment when the hunted realizes that they have lost the game. Only then
will the minotaur charge in for the kill, cutting foes down with powerful strikes
or impaling them on its sharp horns.
Minotaurs are known to dwell in mazes, but they can also be found hiding in
old ruins and other forgotten corners of the world. In any case, they are solitary
creatures, only rarely sharing territory with others of their kind or even more
powerful beings that have cowed them into service. Everyone else is little more
than prey to be hunted.

Demoralize all living creatures within 60 feet that can hear
the minotaur but not see it. Roll once and apply the result
to all creatures. If the targets are in a maze or similarly

UNDERGROUND MOONS
Mu spores dwell in vast caverns,
their pallid underbellies glowing

of a strangely shaped “moon”
adrift near the darkened ceiling
so far above. Caverns can be
faintly lit by this illumination—an
unnerving sight for any traveler
not expecting light in such a

Mu Spore
A mu spore is a thankfully rare fungoid monstrosity of vast power and strange
intellect. Even the smallest mu spores are never less than a hundred feet long from
tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this vast bulk, they are capable of ﬂying
with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their ﬂight.
Many societies tell tales of vast mu spores appearing over cities at the dawn of
apocalyptic events, but they’re more than just ravenous eaters of nations. Mu spores
often possess rare or esoteric knowledge, and if peaceful contact can be made, this
lore can be quite valuable. Their spores can also be used to craft certain foul drugs
or deadly alchemical poisons, but harvesting these ingredients is dangerous, as the
spores are not viable for long once they’ve been shed, forcing alchemists seeking to
harvest them to operate in perilously close proximity to the abominations.

A mummy guardian might serve
alongside a mummy pharaoh or
with zombies, skeletons, animated
objects, or any other undead or
constructs that might be found in
their tomb lairs.
Mummy
While many cultures practice mummiﬁcation of the dead for benign reasons,
undead mummies are created through foul rituals, typically to provide eternally
vigilant guardians.
Mummy Guardian
The majority of mummies were created by cruel and selﬁsh masters to serve as
guardians to protect their tombs from intruders. The traditional method of creating
a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the
poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically
starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents,
and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the ﬂesh. The victim remains
immobile but painfully aware during the ﬁnal stages, where its now-useless entrails
are extracted before it’s shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a
necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in
the potentially distant future. While it’s certainly possible
to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from
an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these
foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel
that such methods result in inferior undead—the pain and
agony of death by mummiﬁcation being an essential step in
the process.
Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are
more than just physical shells of ﬂesh and bone—they retain fragmented,
distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their
living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of
those who yet live. This burning rage only intensiﬁes over the centuries of
waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy
guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in
pursuit of glorious slaughter.

to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from
an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these
foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel
that such methods result in inferior undead—the pain and
agony of death by mummiﬁcation being an essential step in
the process.
Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are
more than just physical shells of ﬂesh and bone—they retain fragmented,
distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their
living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of
those who yet live. This burning rage only intensiﬁes over the centuries of
waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy
guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in
pursuit of glorious slaughter.

NAGAS AND OTHERS
Dark nagas might rule over goblins
(page 180), orcs (page 256),
xulgaths (page 336), or decadent
folk, especially corrupt aristocrats.
Guardian nagas might be found
with other goodly creatures of any
sort, from fey in natural sites to
constructs in ancient vaults.
Naga
Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable
intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble
those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all
but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward
away foes, little is understood of the naga’s unsettling physiology.
Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the
accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire
nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society—an entire empire
ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers
with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.
Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering
them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins.
In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually
unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be
worshipped as gods.
Dark Naga
Dark nagas are wicked, jealous creatures that crave power and wealth. Indeed,
the dark naga sees such ideals as spiritual expressions of an essential truth: if
one can take something, that something is theirs to have. The dark naga sees
other creatures as lessers worthy only of subjugation or as rivals who must
be eliminated.
Dark nagas dwell in remote places other creatures have forsaken,
searching abandoned ruins for wealth and potent magic items. Those
unlucky trespassers into a dark naga’s lair typically ﬁnd themselves as
the naga’s slaves or playthings, put to sleep with the monster’s poison or
incinerated by its deadly magic. Some dark nagas are more disposed
toward socializing than others; in these cases, they may become
wicked despots who rule over enclaves of captive or unsuspecting
subjects. Subtler dark nagas, especially those who crave ﬁner
luxuries, dwell in or under the wealthy settlements and use their
wiles to garner a decadent following, forming something
akin to a cult with the naga as the jewelry-bedecked object
of worship.

Although not true dinosaurs,
pterosaurs are often found in
the same regions as dinosaurs
and other megafauna, wheeling

Pterosaur
Pterosaurs are primitive ﬂying creatures. While many are smaller than a human,
the two presented below are quite a bit larger. Each of these creatures could
pose a serious threat to a person.
These ﬂying reptiles can be found in a wide selection of regions, but they tend
to soar above warm or temperate climates.

ANCIENT GUARDIANS
The practice of conjuring and
binding shining children to
serve as guardians of important
locations was a popular one in
Thassilon. Even today, thousands
of years after this empire’s fall,
adventurers can still encounter
shining children in ancient ruins,
guarding treasures and forgotten
lore from the distant past.
Shining Child
Shining children are wicked, enigmatic monsters that roam remote planes
and untraveled corners of the universe in search of esoteric lore. With their
abnormally gaunt frames, long white hair, and unnerving, four-ﬁngered hands,
shining children are both strangely familiar and otherworldly in appearance,
though they are barely visible within the shroud of blinding light they
continually emit. Their faces are truly horrible, however, as their overlarge
eyes and distended, gaping mouths reveal their heads to be voids ﬁlled with
unnatural light. Shining children use this light as a weapon, weaving illusions
and focusing beams of ﬁery brilliance.
Because of their reputation as scholars of the alien and the eldritch, shining
children are sometimes summoned by powerful wizards or occultists in search
of rare knowledge. The creatures never give away their lore without some price,
though, and typically demand in return the performance of contemptible deeds
that further their inscrutable, far-ranging plans.
These mysterious beings are natives of the Astral Plane. In that
vast plane, accretions of metaphysical matter gradually accumulate
and eventually coalesce into demiplanes. During this tumultuous
process, sparks of living light sometimes shear off the newly formed
planes, and these sparks of raw planar energy somehow transform
into shining children. Every newly formed demiplane leaves a different
mental imprint on its shining “offspring,” making it easy
for shining children to telepathically recognize their
brothers and sisters. Forever trapped in apparently
adolescent bodies, shining children dedicate themselves
to scholarship and violence with equal measure in a
futile effort to understand their roles in the multiverse
and the burning injustice of their births.
Shining children confuse most other creatures with
their refusal to use individual names in favor of alternating
between referring to each other singularly and collectively.
