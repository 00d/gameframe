Aeon
Aeons have always been the caretakers of reality and defenders of the natural
order of balance. Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its
manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects
of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of
existence. Aeons can bring weal or woe when they appear in a region, and
their machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their
reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others—
they simply create the results they insist through their strange envisioning
communication are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.
As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a
presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the
latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness
to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as
inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and
while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very
much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against
imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against
the forces of chaos.
Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome
the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables
once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the
Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of
Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off
long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it
was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin
the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing
perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the
truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons­—
but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded
to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and
even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few
have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most
of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to
continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their
duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as
the aeons themselves.
Arbiter
These spherical inevitables are scouts and diplomats. Found throughout
the multiverse, they have traditionally kept watch over on chaos and its
agents. With the announcement of the Convergence, many arbiters now
serve as go-betweens among the aeon alliance and its mortal associates.

AEON DIVINITIES
Whether the aeons serve an actual
divinity, a philosophical concept,
or merely a “supreme oneness” is
a topic hotly debated by planar
scholars. The aeons themselves
are silent, referring to this being or
concept as the Monad, a “condition
of all.” Regardless of what the
Monad actually is, there certainly
exists another category of powerful
aeons—the primal inevitables, each
a unique demigod with its own
powers and goals. Relatively few
primal inevitables remain today,
for nearly three-quarters of their
irreplaceable kind have fallen in the
endless battle with the inexorable
forces of entropy.

from its body that deals 3d6 electricity damage (DC 17 basic Reﬂex save). Following
such a burst, the arbiter becomes stunned for 24 hours.
Axiomite
According to the axiomites, their kind rose from the raw mathematical
underpinnings of the universe, manifesting as great builders who created the
ancient, colossal cities of the Outer Planes and gave life to the mechanical
inevitables. According to the aeons, axiomites are part of the Monad, having
both risen from and rebelled against it long ago. Since the Convergence, most
axiomites have recognized this as a fundamental truth, particularly after the aeons
showed the axiomites how the Utopian language has formed as an amalgam of
aeon envisioning and formulaic mathematical
expression. Most axiomites live in the perfect
city of Axis, which they continually act to improve,
thus reﬁning the concept of perfection itself.
A particular axiomite may look like any
humanoid creature, though the particular form it takes
on does not affect its abilities. Beneath this assumed form,
all axiomites are the same—clouds of glowing, crystalline
dust that constantly swirls and congeals into complex
tangles of symbols and equations, evincing their existence
as literal creatures of pure mathematical law.
Axiomites arise from the souls of lawful neutral mortals, particularly those
who were, in life, mathematicians, architects, crafters, or philosophers.
While these souls do not retain any memories of their lives in the transition
into axiomites, their life skills and experiences nevertheless serve a valuable
metaphysical resource during formation.

to gaseous form. It can cast spells, but it can’t make melee or ranged attacks
in this state. It can return to its humanoid form by using this action while in
crystalline dust form.
AXIOMITES IN AXIS
On the planar metropolis of Axis,
an axiomite ﬁlls one of three roles:
construction and maintenance of
inevitables, building and repairing
Axis’s buildings, and exploring the
laws and constants that underlie all
of reality.

Kolyarut
Kolyarut inevitables are enforcers of bargains and punishers of those who fail
to uphold them. Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among a
humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable
inevitables, and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among
the most talkative of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an
encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts
in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.

Pleroma
Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation
of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is
a constant state of ﬂux between these two poles, their forms a shifting
cloak of black where galaxies and other celestial objects ﬂit in and out of
existence, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature,
self-contained universe.
Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and
malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They
believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this
essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of
the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.

Envisioning Pleromas care little for communication with other creatures,
but when they do convey information, they do so wordlessly through a
series of psychic projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100
feet but is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have
a language, though the aeon’s meaning to non-aeons can be vague and is often
mysterious. An aeon can use this ability to communicate ﬂawlessly with any other
aeon on the same plane as itself.
INEVITABLE FATES
The fact that the aeons known
as inevitables seem to be on the
decline is taken by some planar
scholars as metaphysical proof
that entropy is on the rise and the
Great Beyond is past its prime and
on the way to the end of this cycle
of reality.

Change Shape Ȳ˓ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) Once per round, a veiled
master can take on the appearance of a humanoid of Large, Medium, or Small size or
resume its true form. While in humanoid form, the veiled master’s Speed is 30 feet, and it
loses its mucus cloud aura and swim Speed.
If the humanoid form assumed lacks
the aquatic trait, the veiled master
loses its own aquatic trait as well. In
humanoid form, the veiled master can
use weapons, or it can make Strikes
that work like its tentacle attack but
use the reach of its current form. If
the assumed form has fangs or claws,
the veiled master can also make such
Strikes, but these attacks lack the veiled master’s slime.
Consume Memories (mental, occult) When a veiled
master makes a fangs Strike against a creature,
it can consume some of that creature’s memories. The target must succeed at a
DC 37 Fortitude saving throw or become stupeﬁed 1. A veiled master regains 5
Hit Points each time it successfully consumes memories. When
a veiled master consumes memories, it learns some of the
creature’s memories (subject to the GM’s discretion).
Delayed Suggestion (enchantment, occult) When a veiled master
successfully casts dominate on a creature, a suggestion
spell triggers when the dominate spell ends. This suggestion
usually causes the target to return to the veiled master, so
the creature can cast dominate again, but a veiled master can
set the suggestion to diﬀerent orders if it wishes.
Slime (curse, occult, virulent) As alghollthu master, but DC 36.
Tentacle Flurry ʚʖ The veiled master thrashes about with its tentacles. Make
a tentacle Strike against each creature within its reach. Roll only one attack
roll, and roll the damage only once for all targets.
Thoughtlance (curse, enchantment, occult) A creature touched by the
veiled master’s tentacles, whether those tentacles deal damage or not,
must attempt a DC 34 Will save, becoming slowed 1 on a failure or
slowed 2 on a critical failure. Each time the aﬀected creature ends its
turn, its slowed value decreases by 1.
OTHER ALGHOLLTHUS
While the veiled masters are the
rulers of alghollthu society, they are
not the most powerful of their kind.
Greater, more mysterious creatures
that function as organic thought
networks, immense aquatic engines
of war, or specialized extractors
of forgotten secrets dwell among
their sunken cities. Meanwhile,
the world above remains infested
with creatures that were originally
created by the alghollthus but have
long since drifted away from their
aquatic progenitors to become their
own sinister monstrosities.

Animated Object
Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic,
animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples
of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as
guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack.
Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants
created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
Animated Broom
Animated brooms perform menial tasks of cleaning and upkeep, but they can
step in to defend a room from intrusion if needed. These simple animated
objects can be found with greater frequency than more complicated and
costly objects.

Construct Armor Like normal objects, an animated broom has Hardness. This Hardness
reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated
broom is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged
by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 14.
Speed 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ bristles +6 (agile, magical, ﬁnesse), Damage 1d4 bludgeoning plus dust
Dust A creature hit by an animated broom’s bristles must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude
save or spend its next action coughing. Even if hit by multiple dust attacks, the
creature has to spend only 1 action coughing to clear the dust out. A creature that
doesn’t breathe is immune to this eﬀect.
Animated Armor
Suits of animated armor see use both as guardians and as training partners in
high-end martial academies able to afford the extravagance. They are most often
found in wizard laboratories and ancient dungeons.

Animated statues are often used to guard crypts, small shrines, or areas in
government buildings where they can be positioned amid normal statues to
hide their true nature until an intruder arouses their ire. Adventurers’ suspicions
ANIMATING OBJECTS
Most animated objects
encountered by adventurers are
permanently animated creatures,
either created by rituals or given
life by infusions of positive energy.
Restless spirits, certain ghosts, and
other haunting undead inﬂuences
can also give rise to animated
objects, although in cases like
the poltergeist (page 264), what
appears to be an animated object
may merely be an evil force using
its magic to hurl furnishings about
as weapons.

Brazier The statue carries a wide brazier full of hot coals. To make ﬂaming coal Strikes
or use Burn Alive, the statue must have the brazier held in one hand or otherwise
have it within reach. Instead of targeting the statue with an attack, a creature can
target the brazier directly. The brazier has the same AC and saves as the statue.
Dealing 15 cold damage to the brazier
or dousing it with at least 2 gallons of
water extinguishes the coals. This
prevents the statue from using
Burn Alive and causes its
ranged attacks to no longer

The
statue grinds a creature it

GUARDED TREASURES
Animated objects are mindless
constructs. While this leaves
them no concept of the value
of treasure, they are often
used as guardians for vaults or
repositories of valuables. In these
cases, the treasures they guard
can vary wildly, but should be of a
value appropriate for the animated
object’s level.

Arboreal regents and other wielders of powerful primal magic grant temporary

Arboreal Regent
Arboreal regents—also called treants­—are lumbering, solitary creatures
responsible for guarding an entire forest. They take an especially long view
of affairs and never act brashly or without much deliberation. They
occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share
news and pass their wisdom down to the arboreal wardens that have
sprouted under their watch. In times of grave danger, all the groves in a
region may gather for a great months-long meeting to plan and, eventually,
act upon a threat.
The typical arboreal regent is 30 feet tall, has a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and
weighs 4,500 pounds.

Awaken Tree ʚʖ (concentrate, primal) The arboreal regent causes a tree within 180
feet to uproot itself and ﬁght as a minion using the statistics for an awakened tree.
The arboreal regent can control up to two awakened trees at a time, and it can
issue commands to both trees as a single action, which has the concentrate and
auditory traits.
Sunder Objects When an arboreal regent damages an item or structure, it
deals an additional 2d10 damage to that item or structure.
Throw Rock Ȱɵ
FUNGUS NETWORKS
Particularly old arboreal regents
and other powerful arboreals can
tap into the extensive network of
fungus that connects the roots
of all the trees in the forest. By
doing so, the arboreal can learn
of threats throughout the entire
woodland, even from miles away.

ARCHON DIVINITIES
As with angels and azatas, the
most powerful of archons are
a caste of demigods known
collectively as empyreal lords.
Each archon empyreal lord is a
unique and powerful creature
that keeps a domain somewhere
in Heaven and is worshipped on
Material Plane worlds. Archon
divinities serve a variety of goals
and focus on diﬀerent aspects
of righteousness. Some, such as
Zohls, hold inﬂuence over the
pursuit of truth and determined
investigations, while others,
like Damerrich, the demigod
of executions, emphasize the
punishment of unrepentant
wrongdoers and seek to obliterate
evil in all its forms.
Archon
Archons are guardians of Heaven and enemies of chaos and evil. They openly
ﬁght back the spread of ﬁends but also quietly nurture the seeds of virtue within
mortals, teaching the denizens of the Material Plane how to act with honor and
integrity, enact just laws, and cast off sin and temptation.
Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest
in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious
voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their
new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin
as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons
as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue,
such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of
mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons
sometimes ﬁnd themselves at odds with azatas.
Lantern Archon
Friendly, curious, and eternally optimistic, lantern archons embody the virtue of
hope. They are formed of living light given corporeal shape, and they serve as
beacons, guiding mortals out of their darkest moments and toward the path of
righteousness. Their luminous bodies can ﬂicker with the subtlety of a candle
ﬂame or ﬂare up like a torch. Lantern archons can control all aspects of their light
as easily as other creatures control their facial expressions, leading them to change
color, twinkle, and otherwise dim and brighten in time
with their actions and words. While effervescent
and chipper in conversation, lantern archons are
impressively stoic mobile support troops and
guardians in times of conﬂict, and are capable
of uniting to form powerful warriors of light
called gestalts.

a ranged light ray Strike (+18 attack, Damage 3d4 ﬁre and 3d4 good), and the bonus
from its Lantern of Hope increases to +3. When the gestalt separates, its remaining
Hit Points are divided evenly among the lantern archons, and if the gestalt had fewer
than 9 HP, some of the lantern archons die.
Lantern of Hope Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, mental) The lantern archon
shines as a beacon of hope. Good allies within 30 feet gain a +1 status bonus to
damage rolls and to saving throws against crushing despair.

Crimson Worm
Among the most dangerous cave worms are the ﬁery crimson worms. In addition
to being even larger than azure or purple worms, the crimson worm has a penchant
for burrowing through volcanic regions that, over the generations, have infused
it with a supernatural link to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The molten heart of an
active volcano is an attractive lair for a crimson worm, as are the sprawling ﬁelds
of bubbling magma found in the deepest reaches of the Darklands. Legends from
ancient peoples, precursor dwarven societies, and colonists of the Elemental
Planes populated moats of lava with crimson worms likely have some basis in
truth, although the methods such ancients used to keep these “moat worms”
contained and prevented them from chewing their way through fortress
foundations must have been signiﬁcant.
Crimson worms sometimes frequent areas on the surface where volcanism
creates hot springs or other geothermal features, but even then they prefer
to spend most of their time burrowing through the ground in their never-ending
search for sustenance. Surface lands claimed by crimson worms are notable for
the mound-shaped burrows these creatures leave behind as they dig.
NOTORIOUS WORMS
Some societies view the immense
cave worms as natural disasters
or incarnations of wrathful gods.
Cave worms that have been active
in a region often become part of
that area’s local lore. For example,
in the notorious Cinderlands of
eastern Varisia, Shoanti have
long told tales of Cindermaw, an
immense crimson worm viewed
by some as worthy of worship,
and by others as the ultimate test
of bravery.

CAVE WORM GUARDIANS
Cave worms are notoriously dim
witted, driven primarily by purely
animalistic needs to feed and
reproduce. This hasn’t prevented
attempts to use them as guardians
for their lairs, if not to tame them.
Magic can be used to maintain
control over a worm, but gifted,
patient, and brave animal trainers
can condition cave worms to
serve in all manner of roles, such
as living siege engines, shocking
methods of executing foes, or
merely pets.

Deep Gnome
These distant cousins to gnomes are reclusive, underground dwellers.
Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or
brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray
hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep
gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely
interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are
slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to
prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement.
The ﬁrst deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their
early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group
of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and
it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the
gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey
who might inﬁltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons
for the gnomes’ relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands
of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed
the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep
gnome of today.
Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at ﬁrst glance, they
retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more
emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what
seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an
extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are
close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require
to process their feelings.
Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby duergar
(pages 138–139) communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even
religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved
into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor
duergars are particularly proud of these conﬂicts, but both insist they were in
the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars ﬁght has left
a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities,
leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even
more than other strangers. This can result in non-duergar dwarves
being driven off from deep gnome cities before being able to explain
themselves. A dwarf and even those traveling with a dwarf require patience
and tenacity when attempting to deal with deep gnomes holding such views.
Svirfneblins value crafting and many decorate their cavernous homes with
paintings on the walls, often incorporating the rock in clever ways. They also
value crystals and gems, making jewelry and beads that they string through
their hair.
Deep Gnome Scout
Deep gnome scouts patrol the tunnels that lead into their
settlements. Some scout alone to make the most of their
stealth, but others form groups for the sake of safety.

DEEP GNOME FAITH
While most deep gnomes aren’t
particularly religious, they respect
the spirits of nature, especially
those found within earth and
stone. Most deep gnome druids,
known as “rockwardens,” learn
Terran, the language of the Plane
of Earth, in order to speak with
these forces, and some can even
entreat with earth elementals.
The handful of deep gnome
communities of faith tend to
worship neutral deities, such
as Gozreh, Nethys, Pharasma,
and the gnomish goddess Nivi
Rhombodazzle. In such areas, a
small church to the worshipped
god is erected in the center of
town and is open to the public
around the clock, allowing the
deep gnomes to worship as they
see ﬁt.

Stegosaurus
The stegosaurus is easily recognized by its twin rows of diamond-shaped dorsal
plates that run down its spine, and thick tail adorned with four large spikes. This
strange conﬁguration protects this herbivore from predators, as the stegosaurus
can hunker down to interpose its dorsal plates between an attacker and its thick
body. A stegosaurus defends itself by swinging its spiked tail at larger foes and
trampling smaller opponents underfoot.
The stegosaurus often inhabits grasslands, where nutritious vegetation is
plentiful and only its dorsal plates rise above waving ﬁelds of tall grass. The
stegosaurus is among the most curious of dinosaurs, and hunters often ﬁnd it easy
to bait them with shiny trinkets or strange noises. A stegosaurus is about 30 feet
long, 16 feet high at the top of its highest dorsal plate, and weighs between 2 and
3 tons.
The stegosaurus is generally more even-tempered and even gentle, despite its
size, than the ankylosaurus. This combination makes it even more popular as
a trained pet or guard, but even then one should take care to not annoy the
dinosaur—an angry or annoyed stegosaurus can lash out with its tail with little
warning. Often, it’s wiser to train smaller variants, such as the kentrosaurus.
Regardless, their dorsal plates make this dinosaur a poor choice as a mount.

Triceratops
Triceratopses are muscular quadrupeds with powerful but short
legs, thick necks, and heads crowned by a wide, bony frill. Though
they bear a large horn on their snout and one on each brow, these
dinosaurs are herbivores and use these bony protrusions only
to defend themselves from attackers or in dramatic clashes
DINOSAUR GUARDIANS
As with most animals, dinosaurs
can be tamed or domesticated,
but the diﬃculty of this task
increases along with the dinosaur’s
level. Lizardfolk and orcs are fond
of using dinosaurs as beasts of
burden, workhorses, mounts,
or even war beasts. Certain
dinosaurs, such as velociraptors
and deinonychuses, make excellent
trackers as well. The largest and
most dangerous dinosaurs, such as
the tyrannosaurus, are generally
avoided, although more powerful
creatures like giants have been
known to be able to keep them
as pets, guardians, or even brutal
executioners. In certain cities,
dinosaurs are popularly featured
as combatants in blood sports and
other gladiatorial battles.

Blue Dragon
Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons.
Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often
lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and
gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue
dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead
think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a
cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as
a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to
use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.
Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and
hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter
how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs
palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and
embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efﬁciency.

DEYRUBRUJAN
Responsible for destroying three
separate villages in Avistan after
a lengthy raid to seek hidden
information, this great wyrm blue
dragon maintains a fortress lair in
the desert nation of Thuvia. Called
Hidden Nest, Deyrubrujan’s lair
is a factory where Usij cultists
manufacture all manner of
potions, drugs, and poisons, while
ultimately seeking a way to make
a counterfeit Sun Orchid Elixir.
Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They
make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in
battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to
destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their
desert lairs.
The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and
secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in
comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can
come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions
conceal the ediﬁce from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a
blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel—
expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.

with House Thrune where she
agreed to instruct a handful of
apprentices. After a few years of
instruction, these "apprentices"
vanished one night, taking
volumes of the dragon’s crucial
notes—a slight she has not
forgotten and plans to seek
vengeance for.

Green Dragon
Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as
the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand
their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that
takes advantage of a green dragon’s ﬁxations may end in a diplomatic outcome,
but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic
dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they
consider foolish is very low.
Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures
and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the
most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart
of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home
in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.
Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of
their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is
something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some
green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most
prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of
them delve deeply into one particular ﬁeld of study, and
correspond with other scholars in the ﬁeld by adopting
a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless
of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve
themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes
them more likely to deal diplomatically with other
creatures in order to obtain new information.
Their hoards are typically well kept,
organized, and ﬁlled with tomes of lore and
scrolls of magic along with antiquities they
collect for their own inscrutable reasons.
Many of these treasures come from across
the globe, and many an adventurer has
survived an encounter with a green dragon
by stroking its ego and plying it with rare
artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.

DARALATHXYL
Known as the Sixth King of the Five
Kings Mountains, this red dragon
has lived in Droskar’s Crag for over
two millennia. Thankfully, this
powerful dragon slumbers for long
periods, but like a restless volcano,
he is due for a rampage.
Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 90 feet, DC 37
Miasma (aura, poison); 20 feet. After the dragon uses its Breath Weapon, a cloud of
poison gas continues to emanate from its body for 1 round. Any creature that ends
its turn in the miasma takes 4d6 poison damage (DC 37 basic Fortitude save). Any
creature in the miasma is concealed and treats other creatures as concealed. The
dragon can see through this concealment.
Twisting Tail Ǻȓ As young green dragon.
Speed 50 feet, ﬂy 200 feet, swim 50 feet; trackless step, woodland stride
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +33 (magical, poison, reach 20 feet), Damage 3d12+15 piercing plus 4d4 poison

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, evocation, poison); The dragon breathes a toxic
cloud that deals 18d6 poison damage in a 60-foot cone (DC 37 basic
Fortitude save). The Breath Weapon also creates a miasma. The dragon
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

Red Dragon
The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons,
red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and
their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons
see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind.
With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of
blistering ﬂame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only
unquestioned fact.
Red dragons don’t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they
simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as
servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber
away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and
they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or
disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their
enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving
out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the
dragon’s security.
Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most
likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements.
They want the world to see them in their rightful
place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in
threatening all other creatures. They have no
qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing
to complete their goals—or simply intimidating
others through a public display of brutality
and dominance.
As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magniﬁcence
of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous
places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they ﬁnd them
foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No
matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and
other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes,
the dragon’s internal heat causes these precious metals
to fuse together.

DAHAK
Dahak, the Endless Destruction, is
an ancient dragon god spawned by
the righteous Apsu. Dahak is the
god of destruction, evil dragons,
and greed. After his birth, Dahak
made his way to Hell where he
roamed for ages before returning
to the Material Plane to ﬁght
against his father and siblings,
reveling in destruction and
pledging to destroy the world.

Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Draconic Frenzy ʚʖ As young red dragon.
Draconic Momentum As young red dragon.
Manipulate Flames Ȱɵ (arcane, concentrate, transmutation); The red dragon attempts
to take control of a magical ﬁre or a ﬁre spell within 100 feet. If it succeeds at a
counteract check (counteract level 10, counteract modiﬁer +32), the original caster
loses control of the spell or magic ﬁre, control is transferred to the dragon, and the
dragon counts as having Sustained the Spell with this action (if applicable). The dragon
can choose to end the spell instead of taking control, if it chooses.
White Dragon
The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons
are brutish, predatory, and chieﬂy motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all
other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull,
though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean
the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because
they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are
as difﬁcult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed
at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane
jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack
comes, it’s bloody and relentless.
Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from
people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding
tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds.
They ﬂy out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass
near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy
niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference
for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and ﬁne food—over coins
or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly
to their speciﬁcations, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their
homes over the years.

LOGRIVICH
When Queen Elvanna still ruled
Irrisen, she appointed the young
white dragon, Logrivich, to the
Winter Guard, the force that
maintains order in the nation’s
capital of Whitethrone. He resided
in a clock tower, though he hasn’t
been seen in a few years, leading
some to think that he either moved

Dragon, Metallic
Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities
revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have
ever seen a metallic dragon ﬁrsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals’
lives—and of their passing—always spread far and wide. Named for the way
their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare,
and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and
they don’t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all,
to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of
water—though they may seem similar at ﬁrst glance, the raw power, breadth, and
grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.
In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts
(page 104–115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the
multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe
are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and
defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such
as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature
and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure
to exist, including dragons on far-ﬂung planes of existence and, it is rumored,
primeval dragons who soar between the stars.
Shape-Changing Dragons
Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to inﬁltrate settlements or
inﬂuence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability:
Change Shape Ȱɵ (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); The dragon takes on
the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or
attack and damage modiﬁers with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its
Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Metallic Dragon Spellcasters
Each type of metallic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that
kind. To make a metallic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic
Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in
its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells,
provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also
want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modiﬁer by 1
or 2 to reﬂect its mastery of magic.
Metallic Dragons on Golarion
Metallic dragons are found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in pockets
of wilderness where they can carve a hideout and then take action on political
and social issues, both in their local area and on a wider scale. Their everlasting
war with chromatic dragons keeps them in close proximity to their evil brethren;
in regions where metallic and chromatic dragons’ territories intersect, humanoid
settlements get caught in the crossﬁre, and villagers and city-dwellers alike
rightfully fear for their own safety.
Silver dragons lair in abundance around the cold wastes west of Mendev, as a
consequence of the days when they joined thousands of crusaders who marched
headlong into the demon-infested Worldwound. Bronze dragons are abundant
in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they
wage war alongside other freedom ﬁghters to overthrow devils in the neighboring
empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking
part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare—an
ancient gold wyrm—has begun a grand social experiment he calls “the Glorious
Endeavor.” Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly
controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form
of eugenics.

Brass Dragon
Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They
particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids,
delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them
haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage
in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics
so they can anticipate future conﬂicts. Along the way, they create extensive
information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all
levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly
assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue
dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice
and equality.
These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all
creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm
others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short
attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their
twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets
and houseplants that they can care for.
Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity
concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in
battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose
territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe
indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and
unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.
Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and
while they keep their lairs hidden, they often
build near humanoid settlements.

Bronze Dragon
Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most
likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly
creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off
on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists,
guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze
dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to
crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to ﬁnd an important location worthy of
their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.
Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and afﬁnity for electricity means they are
a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly
discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath.
Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.
While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more
resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline,
of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons
keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, ﬂawless
pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.

Copper Dragon
Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the
wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to
spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to
indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to
pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives
as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are
susceptible to negative inﬂuences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts
performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also
have a difﬁcult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.
Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to
their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes
live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby.
Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped
only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of
Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of
freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical
copper dragon mindset.
A copper dragon’s combat tactics are
as unorthodox as its sense of humor,
as it is more likely to use mockery and
tricks than outright strength to win
its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it
perfects jokes capable of rendering its
foes helpless with laughter.

Gold Dragon
Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their
strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence
of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and
counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin
of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals.
But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and
prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than
rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are,
they necessarily take a wide view of all situations
and never act without considering all possible
options and outcomes. Because of this, gold
dragons willingly converse with any
creature that seeks them out, even evil
chromatic dragons. Mortals might
ﬁnd this behavior strange, considering the long-
standing war between chromatic and metallic
dragons, but dragons know all too well
that desperate situations sometimes call
for drastic alliances. And although gold
dragons might consider brief truces with
their chromatic brethren in the case
of world-ending threats, they also
know when such alliances have run
their course.
When another metallic dragon
faces a quandary or a foe beyond its
own ability to overcome, its best
option is often to seek the counsel
of the eternally wise and gloriously
righteous gold dragons. Locating
these legendary beings is no easy
task, however, for gold dragons are
notoriously reclusive. Their intellect
and wisdom is such that they prefer
to ponder the great questions of life
in seclusion, where they strive to
formulate solutions to the world’s
most pressing problems. As a
result, gold dragons are sometimes
absent when metallic dragons gather
together, or are missing from tribunals
where
their
counsel
would
be
beneﬁcial. Impatient dragons sometimes
begrudge gold dragons for this apparent
unreliability, but such aspersions are
usually a result of jealousy rather than
PARNONERYX
This adult gold dragon had a long
and tragic existence. Formerly an
ally of Iomedae, he was defeated
by a powerful white dragon and
imprisoned in ice. Though freed by
the Glorious Reclamation, he was
soon slain by evil adventurers who
used his head to create a powerful
weapon known as a tathlum—
which was used to lift the siege of
Citadel Rivad and end the Glorious
Reclamation.

any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons
purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.
A gold dragon’s incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means
they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the
rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for
there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate
advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of
garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a
gold dragon’s last-minute intermediation.
Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands
where they can enjoy long, meditative ﬂights without attracting the attention
of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren,
remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortiﬁed lair, such as a forgotten
sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons
may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live
truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and
magical wards.

Silver Dragon
Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost
and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain
peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs
among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far
and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars
of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread
honor, and stamp out evil.
Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much
as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that
silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek
out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins,
and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to
hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors,
APSU
Apsu, the Waybringer, is the god
of good dragons, leadership, and
peace. According to draconic lore,
Apsu spawned the dragon-gods
who created the world. One of his
sons is the destructive draconic
god Dahak. Thus, Apsu is not only
seen as a god and creator to good
dragons, but he also serves as an
immortal father ﬁgure.

usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even
more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive
clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.
Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens
of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides.
In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil
from taking root in the ﬁrst place, and they ensure mortals under their care are
well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem
overzealous or even eager to join the ﬁght against evil, they know that the best
way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment
at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable
problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for
evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support
of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.
Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating
deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice,
virtue, and redemption.

Dragon Turtle
When sailors warn others of the terrible threats of the open sea, they seldom
forget to mention dragon turtles—immense aquatic dragons with rocky
shells similar to those of tortoises and ﬂippers powerful enough to overturn
hardy vessels. These fearsome creatures enjoy being considered as dangerous
as storms or natural disasters by seafaring folk. Dragon turtles delight in
amassing treasure, although most prefer to receive tribute from passing sailors
and often store their hoards in the shipwrecks of vessels once crewed by those
unwilling to surrender their valuables. Dragon turtles are solitary creatures
and hunt in regions encompassing a hundred square miles or more. Although
they normally eat large ﬁsh, they are omnivorous and also eat seaweed or even
foolhardy dragon hunters. Experienced sailors keep a keen eye out for dragon
turtles, preparing to ﬂee should one approach or offer it treasure in exchange
for safe passage.
Most dragon turtles are at least 20 feet wide and 50 feet long, although
some can grow substantially larger. These massive, ancient dragon turtles are
somnolent, and resemble rocky islands from a distance; their prodigious hoards
can be a source of truly ancient sea lore. Legends persist of truly immense
dragon turtles who spend centuries drifting on the surface of the ocean, far from
established shipping lanes or charted waters, with shells that serve as islands
capable of supporting entire ecosystems and even, some claim, small settlements
whose inhabitants know nothing of land that doesn’t drift across the sea.

in the open ocean, some live along
coastlines or even within large
inland lakes.

CLAY GOLEMS
The remains of clay golems are
worth more to archaeologists
and scholars than to merchants.
The magniﬁcent treasures
often guarded by these ancient
wardens, however, are another
matter entirely.
Alchemical Rupture When an alchemical golem takes physical damage from a critical hit
or is aﬀected by a shatter spell, one glass chamber within its body shatters, spewing
alchemical liquid in a 5-foot emanation. Roll on the alchemical chambers list (see
above) to determine which one shatters—on a roll of 1–5, creatures in the area take
10d6 damage of the appropriate type (DC 28 basic Reﬂex). On a roll of 6, creatures
must instead save against the sickness eﬀect.
Golem Antimagic harmed by sonic (5d8, 2d6 from areas or persistent damage); healed
by acid (area 2d4 HP); slowed by cold
Vulnerable to Shatter Casting a shatter spell on an alchemical golem aﬀects the golem
normally, but also causes an alchemical rupture (see above).
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ syringe +22 (magical, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d10+6 piercing plus
alchemical injection
Ranged Ȱɵ bomb +20 (magical, thrown 20 feet), Damage see Generate Bomb
Alchemical Injection When an alchemical golem hits a creature with a syringe Strike,
roll 1d6 on the alchemical chambers list to determine the additional eﬀect of the
attack. The syringe deals an additional 2d6 damage of the appropriate type (or
exposes the target to the sickness eﬀect, as appropriate).
Generate Bomb Ȱɵ (manipulate) The golem ﬁlls an empty vial from one of its alchemical
chambers to create a bomb and then makes a bomb Strike. Determine the type of bomb
created by rolling 1d6 on the alchemical chambers list above. On a roll of 1–4, it creates
the corresponding greater alchemical bomb: an acid ﬂask from chamber 1, a frost vial
from chamber 2, bottled lightning from chamber 3, or alchemist’s ﬁre from chamber 4.
On a roll of 5, it creates a poisonous bomb that deals 3d10 poison damage and 3 poison
splash damage with no other eﬀects. On a roll of 6, it creates a sickness bomb, which
exposes the target and all creatures in the splash radius to the sickness eﬀect; creatures
hit by only the splash receive a +2 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude saves.
Clay Golem
Traditionally, clay golems are crafted in the image of a deity and used as
guardians of tombs or sacred crypts. Clay golems have the power to lay curses
upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that
these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While
this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly
around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.
The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable,
making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when
damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a
rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems
are maintained and in good working order—or otherwise place them on the other
side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.

fewer Hit Points at the start of its turn, the golem must succeed at a DC 5 ﬂat check
or go berserk. A berserk golem wildly attacks the nearest living creature, or
the nearest object if no creatures are nearby.

INFAMOUS
GRAVEKNIGHTS
Several of Golarion’s most
notorious villains are graveknights.
The following examples are
among the world’s most infamous
graveknights at large, and may
inspire or serve as villains in your
own games.
Lictor Shokneir: Once the
Hellknight leader of the notorious
Order of the Crux, Lictor Shokneir
was disgraced when he refused
a royal order to disband his
army of butchers. The other
Hellknights surrounded him
and razed his castle, Citadel
Gheisteno, to the ground. However,
Shokneir’s determination sustains
his now-undead form, and he and
his undead legions have rebuilt the
citadel in all its haunting glory.
The Black Prince: Although the
graveknight known simply as
the Black Prince was redeemed
centuries ago as part of Iomedae’s
11 Acts, it is said that the prince’s
armor remains intact—and that
vile forces conspire to reclaim it.
If the armor is donned by one of
the Black Prince’s descendants,
the Inner Sea will be beset by a
terrible villain indeed.
Graveknight
Graveknights are undead warriors granted unlife by a cursed suit of armor.
Creating Graveknights
You can turn an existing, living creature into a graveknight by completing the
following steps. It’s best to build a graveknight from scratch, but if you don’t have
the time, simply apply the template. A creature should be at least level 5 before
being converted to a graveknight.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Increase its attack rolls, AC, saving throws, Perception, and skills by 1, its HP
by 5, and its Strike damage by 1.
GRAVEKNIgHT ABILITIES
A graveknight gains the undead and graveknight traits, and its alignment is usually
adjusted to evil. It loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature and
any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid.
Darkvision
Negative Healing
Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds
its body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living
host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process
restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor
(such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it
into the heart of a volcano.
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious, plus one
energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).
Sacrilegious Aura (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura
uses a positive spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to counteract
it, with the listed counteract modiﬁer.
Devastating Blast ʚʖ (arcane, evocation) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of
energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for
every two levels the graveknight has (basic Reﬂex save). The graveknight can use
this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of
its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait.
Phantom Mount ̂ˬ (arcane, conjuration, summon) The graveknight summons a
supernatural mount as per phantom steed, heightened to a level equal to half the
graveknight’s level. Unlike phantom steed, the steed’s AC and saving throw bonuses
are all 4 lower than the graveknight’s, and the steed has one-third the graveknight’s
Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour
before using this ability again.
Ruinous Weapons At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following
energy types that was relevant to its life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or ﬁre. Any
weapon the graveknight wields gains the eﬀects of the caustic, frost, shock, or ﬂaming
weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune. If the graveknight
is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the eﬀects of the greater versions of
both of these runes.
Weapon Master The graveknight has access to the critical specialization eﬀects of any
weapons it wields.
ALTERNATE GRAVEKNIgHT ABILITIES
Although the abilities listed above are standard for a graveknight, you can create a
more unusual graveknight by substituting one of the aforementioned abilities (except
for its rejuvenation ability) with one of the following.
Betrayed Reviviﬁcation The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead
of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to mental damage, its
weapons deal 1d6 additional mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental
damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reﬂex.

Create Grave Squire The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which
becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its
squire at any distance, see through the squire’s senses, and cast suggestion as a divine
innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success
as one step worse. If the graveknight’s main armor is destroyed, the squire’s piece
expands to cover the squire’s body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the
graveknight’s new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and
must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire.
Dark Deliverance The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level.
Graveknight Armor
Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight’s
essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the
graveknight’s rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the
host, transforming their ﬂesh into the graveknight’s new body. Removing the
curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor
again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while
wearing the armor, or if the graveknight’s rejuvenation
completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer
immediately progresses to stage 3.
Graveknight’s Curse (arcane, curse, necromancy) This curse aﬀects anyone
who wears a graveknight’s armor for at least 1 hour. Saving
Throw Will save; Onset 1 hour; Stage 1 doomed 1 and cannot
remove the armor (1 day); Stage 2 doomed 2, hampered
10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); Stage 3
dies and transforms into the armor’s graveknight.

GREMLIN BELLS
Superstitious societies sometimes
hang tiny bells made of
semiprecious metals in the belief
that such bells will dissuade
gremlins from destroying an
aﬃxed object or infesting a home.
Strangely enough, most gremlins
believe this superstition as well,
and even when a gremlin bell
hasn’t been magically enhanced,
a gremlin usually won’t risk
tinkering with objects that seem to
be protected in such a manner.
Gremlin
Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life
on the Material Plane, ﬁnding distinct niches for their inventive destructiveness.
All gremlins delight in ruining or breaking things, whether it’s something physical
like a device or vehicle or something intangible such as an alliance or relationship.
A gremlin’s greatest joy is watching the collapse of complex creations, preferably
after the lightest and slightest, carefully targeted push from the gremlin. Gremlins
tend to denigrate, bully, or even slaughter their lesser kin, particularly mitﬂits,
whom gremlins (and many others) derisively call “mites.”
Mitflit
Mitﬂits, also known as mites, are self-loathing and pitiful cowards, easily bullied
into servitude by other creatures or even slightly more powerful mitﬂit leaders.
They tame insects, spiders, and other such creatures to serve as faithful allies.
Mitﬂits have lost most of their ancestral gremlin magic, leaving these incomplete
beings full of doubt and insecurity. Mitﬂits ﬁnd companionship in the other base
creatures of the world, and forge bonds of friendship with vermin, the only other
beings that seem willing to accept them. A social structure, even one in which they
are bullied, partially ﬁlls the hole within mitﬂits’ personalities, and they rarely
rebel or rail out unless their rage hits a breaking point.

Self-Loathing (emotion, mental) A mitﬂit’s self-loathing makes it easy to inﬂuence. It
takes a –4 penalty to its Will DC against checks to Coerce, Demoralize, Make an
Impression, and Request.
Vermin Empathy Mitﬂits can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and Request things
of arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals). Most
arthropods have a starting attitude of indiﬀerent to mitﬂits.

Vengeful Anger (emotion, mental) As long as it isn’t frightened, a
mitﬂit gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against a creature that
has previously damaged or tormented it.
Pugwampi
Mean, dog-faced, and craven, pugwampis take disproportionate
enjoyment from the accidents and missteps of other creatures—something
that happens often due to the supernatural aura of ill fortune these gremlins
project. They enjoy preparing pranks involving spikes, excrement, pits full of
spiders, and the like. Pugwampis are somewhat deaf and thus often yell
loudly to each other when not hiding. Many pugwampis worship
gnolls as gods and aspire to be more like gnolls, although gnolls
hate pugwampis even more than most creatures do, due to their
sycophantic fawning.

GREMLIN “TREASURE”
All gremlins are hoarders, and their
nests are cluttered with objects
both valuable and worthless.
Sorting through a gremlin nest can
reveal unexpected treasures like
pieces of jewelry or minor magic
items, but care must also be taken
to avoid being cut on rusty shards
of metal, picking up cursed items,
or disturbing a hidden nest of

Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great

create convoluted plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as
when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to
wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and
murder, though they prefer to lead
victims into traps designed to capture
or incapacitate rather than kill outright.
Deep pits are favorites, since victims
who survive the fall face a slow death from
starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering
at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.

for an hour to imbue an item with a curse at a range of 60 feet. While this
process is lengthy, it’s also unobtrusive and can be performed while Hiding. Jinkins
prefer to use this ability on magic items. The curse makes the item unreliable (DC
5 flat check or waste any action to Interact with or Activate the item), adds
a bizarre requirement to use the item, or imparts some other curse of a
similar caliber.

POLTERGEIST TREASURE
A poltergeist needs items to
hurl as weapons, and over the
centuries of use, only durable
objects survive its rampages.
Silver dinnerware, hatchets, and
books might all be found in a
poltergeist’s collection.
Poltergeist
When a creature dies, and for whatever reason its spirit is unable or unwilling
to leave the site of its death, that spirit may manifest as a poltergeist: a restless
invisible spirit that is still able to manipulate physical objects. Many poltergeists
perished in a way that resulted from or has led to extreme emotional trauma.

Site Bound A poltergeist is tied to a location and can’t travel more than 120 feet from
the place where it was created or formed. Some poltergeists are instead bound to a
speciﬁc room, building, or similar area.

resistance against non-magical)
Natural Invisibility A poltergeist is naturally invisible. It becomes
visible only when it uses Frighten.
Rejuvenation (necromancy, occult) When a poltergeist is
destroyed, it re-forms, fully healed, where it was destroyed
after 2d4 days. A poltergeist can be permanently destroyed
only if someone determines the reason for its existence and
sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.
Telekinetic Defense Ǻȓ Trigger A creature approaches within
10 feet of the poltergeist. Eﬀect The poltergeist makes a
telekinetic object Strike against the triggering creature.
Speed ﬂy 20 feet
Ranged Ȱɵ telekinetic object +13 (evocation, magical, occult,
range increment 60 feet), Damage 2d12 bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing (depending on object)
Occult Innate Spells DC 23, attack +13; 3rd telekinetic
maneuver (at will); Cantrips (3rd) mage hand
Frighten Ȱɵ (concentrate, emotion, fear, incapacitation,
mental); Requirement The poltergeist must be invisible.
Eﬀect The poltergeist becomes visible, appearing as a
skeletal, ghostlike humanoid. Each creature within 30 feet
must attempt a DC 21 Will save, becoming frightened 2 on a failure.
On a critical failure, it’s also ﬂeeing for as long as it’s frightened. On
a success, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute. At the
start of its next turn, the poltergeist becomes invisible again.
Telekinetic Storm ʚʖ (concentrate, evocation, occult); The
poltergeist telekinetically throws numerous small objects,
such as dozens of pieces of silverware or books, either
spreading them out among multiple foes or directing
them at one target.
•
When this eﬀect is spread out among multiple foes,
the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike at a
–2 penalty against each creature within 30 feet. These
count as one attack for the poltergeist’s multiple attack
penalty, and the penalty doesn’t increase until after all
the attacks.
•	 When this eﬀect has only one target, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object
Strike against the target, and the damage increases to 3d12. It deals 1d12 damage
on a failure, and no damage on a critical failure.
DISTURBED REST
One of the most common ways
for a poltergeist to form is when
its burial site is desecrated by
the construction of a dwelling.
This is usually an accident, but
some evil creatures seek out such
burial sites, intentionally creating
poltergeists to serve as guardians.
