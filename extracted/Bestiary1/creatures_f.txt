Faceless Stalker (Ugothol)
Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols—also known as
faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to inﬁltrate settlements
and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders, causing
unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and
eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend
alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their
aquatic masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today,
most faceless stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed
goals without the guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live
as close to the sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures
themselves. Most dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers
of coastal towns.
By instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in
humanoid societies, then guide inﬁltrated settlements down paths of destruction.
Among humanoids who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become
a prominent trailblazer, leading a group to new heights of depravity and
violence. Inevitably, however, faceless stalker inﬁltrators lead their followers
to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves on—either because its true nature
is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled or devastated all
local resources.
An ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking
tongue. Their prey bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major
arteries. Corpses bearing such marks are typically the ﬁrst clues found
to uncover a faceless stalker’s presence, though sometimes they are
overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.

ANCIENT INFLUENCES
The veiled masters inﬂuenced the
ancient Azlanti, and it was they who
invoked the apocalypse of Earthfall
to destroy Azlant when humanity
grew too prideful. That this act also
called down the magical Starstone,
an artifact capable of transforming
mortals into gods, was an ironic
turn of events considering the
alghollthus’ intolerance for faith.

Alghollthu Master (Aboleth)
Aboleths form the core of alghollthu society, and while they are the “common folk”
of their own societies, they see themselves as masters of all others. Unlike their
leaders, who mask their actions using magical disguises, aboleths revel in their
monstrous forms, appearing as primeval ﬁsh with tentacles. Masters of psychic
manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present in the world when
it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to the planet. They see all
other life as something they have the right to control, so the idea that potential
slaves might have faith in a higher power other than themselves enrages aboleths.

creature’s drained condition increases by 1 (permanent).
A remove disease spell can counteract this curse, but
immunity to disease oﬀers no protection against it.
Veiled Master (Vidileth)
The powerful vidileths are the insidious
veiled masters of the alghollthus. These
manipulators of mind and body alike
lead their species in the open, using
their ability to change form to walk
among and deceive humans and
other sapient species. Many veiled
masters are even more powerful than
the typical specimen presented here and can
use a wide range of arcane or occult spells and rituals.
While veiled masters command signiﬁcant
combat prowess and impressive magical skills,
the greatest danger they pose to others is their
uncanny ability to inﬁltrate into societies much
different than their own. The most paranoid of
adventurers and conspiracy scholars worry that every major city has been
infested by secret cabals of vidileths, while others dismiss this as hogwash
and fearmongering. The truth is likely somewhere in between, but it doesn’t
take many veiled masters pulling the strings behind the scenes to wreak havoc
upon an entire nation!
ALGHOLLTHU TREASURE
Although most alghollthus lack
the greed that tempts most
mortals, they do gather wealth
and magical tools to use in their
schemes. A given aboleth or
veiled master might also wear
magical jewelry and other objects.
Faceless stalkers and other
humanoid servants of alghollthus
use weapons and armor, such as
the faceless stalker’s sword or
ulat-kini’s trident, as well as other
tools. These servitor races can be
as acquisitive as other humanoids.

and on foot. Jungle drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run
tactics, picking off the weakest members of a group and dragging their
victims off to ﬁnish their meals as they please.

DRAKE HUNTERS
The allure of hunting a dragon

such a task is fraught with peril.
Unscrupulous adventurers have
been known to instead hunt drakes
and use trophies harvested from
these creatures to deceive locals.

Desert Drake
Distant cousins of blue dragons that lack their relatives’ magical talents and
intelligence, these desert-dwelling drakes are nonetheless dangerous ambush
predators, preying upon isolated desert travelers and outposts for food and
supplies. They retain their true-blooded forebears’ resistance to electricity and
afﬁnity for sandy environs. Desert drakes’ scales range in coloration from rust-
brown to light tan and ocher shades, mimicking the colors of the dunes they
call home.
Desert drakes are among the lightest and most compact of the drakes, though
this shouldn’t be mistaken for frailty. Their swooped-back horns and feather-
thin wings are adapted to make burrowing as easy as possible. Indeed, a desert
drake’s powerful neck makes wriggling through sand and other loose scree as
easy as walking for it.

OTHER DRAKES
The drakes presented on these
pages are far from the only types
that exist. Forest drakes have green
hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be
found in temperate woodlands. Rift
drakes, among the most powerful
of their kind, spit clinging caustic
vapors and dwell in badlands and
regions scarred by devastating
magical disasters. Sea drakes can be
found in oceans across the world,
lava drakes in volcanic crevasses,
mist drakes along coastlines and in
salt marshes, and spire drakes in
ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly,
many other types of drakes lurk in
the far corners of the world!

FAILED FLESHWARPS
Not every ﬂeshwarp emerges
from its vat capable of survival.
Many perish within minutes, as
organs fundamental for life simply
fail or collapse in on themselves.
Fleshwarpers can usually recycle
failed ﬂeshwarps back into the mix
quickly enough, but now and then,
remnants known as ﬂeshdregs are
stable enough to live pain-wracked
lives of their own. These foul
creatures often infest ﬂeshwarper
holdings, like rats or other vermin
do in less awful locations.
Fleshwarp
Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies.
They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying
transformative technique known as ﬂeshwarping. Though the ﬂeshwarping
process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow
torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their ﬂesh
and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of ﬂesh
results in countless variations of ﬂeshwarps, and the following are just a couple
of examples of these horrors.
Grothlut
Sluglike abominations, grothluts are ﬂeshwarps that were once humans. While
their head and torsos are vaguely human, their arms are rubbery and move
awkwardly at their sides. Wretched creatures, they moan piteously when other
creatures are near, perhaps as the last remnants of their shattered human
consciousness pleads to be free from their horrid warped form.
Many ﬂeshwarpers consider the grothlut to be a failure of a creation, as the
transformation all but stamps out the human consciousness. Others disagree,
arguing that warping the creature’s mind makes it all the more useful, since
its stupidity makes it pliable and easy to herd. Drow typically use grothluts
as guardians that slowly patrol the edges of their enclaves. Once in position,
grothluts can be used as crude shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces
before more-valuable warriors wade in and cut down the enemies who have been
nauseated by the grothluts’ exploded organs and ﬂesh.

Disgusting Demise (acid, poison) When the grothlut is reduced to 0 Hit Points, its

a 30-foot emanation. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save

immune for 1 minute. The grothlut can activate
or deactivate the aura by using a single
free action that has the concentrate trait. A
grothlut usually does not begin moaning until it
senses the presence of a non-grothlut creature,
and it usually stops once it doesn’t sense
any more such creatures.

Wide Swing Ȱɵ The frost giant makes a single greataxe Strike and compares the attack
roll result to the ACs of up to two foes within its reach. This counts as two attacks
for the frost giant’s multiple attack penalty.
Fire Giant
The most militaristic of all giants, ﬁre giants focus obsessively on learning
combat techniques, mastering the arts of forging weapons and armor,
and ﬁnding new ways to dominate their enemies. As a result, their
social and political structures are grounded ﬁrmly in martial
hierarchies, with a strict emphasis on following the
orders of one’s superior, no matter if you are
accountable to a lowly soldier or report to
a powerful ofﬁcer. As soon as a ﬁre giant
can walk, they are ﬁtted with their
ﬁrst suit of forged armor. This armor
is constantly remolded and replaced
as the ﬁre giant matures, both to ensure they are
comfortable with steel against their skin and also
to teach the giant as early as possible that they bear the
burden of ﬁghting to protect their traditions and way of life. To
a ﬁre giant, death is the ﬂame in which the future is forged.
Fire giants are usually identiﬁed by their powerful stature, bright-orange hair
that ﬂickers and dances as if it were aﬂame, and heavy steel armor worn over
garments of crimson, amber, or black. Most ﬁre giants are covered in scars and
refuse to conceal or obstruct them, as each jagged mark serves as a reminder of
a valuable lesson they learned in battle. A typical ﬁre giant stands 12 to 16 feet
tall, weighs about 7,000 pounds, and lives to be 350 years old.

Cloud Giant
The graceful and regal cloud giants have skin of milky white to powdery blue.
Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are neutral,
but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil. Good cloud
giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and are interested
in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It’s not uncommon for such
giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships
with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist
and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves
and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other
creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate
a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders
often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins.
Legends persist of ﬂoating cities ruled by magically gifted cloud giant
queens and kings. While most cloud giants plainly state that such claims
are pure fantasy, others are mysteriously tight-lipped or evasive about
the matter.

popular, as are more magical
creatures like hell hounds,
manticores, griﬀons, and the like.

LICH CRAFTING
Liches spend a good deal of their
downtime crafting magic items. In
particular, a lich will create items
that help it defeat and overcome
known problems. This fact can
prove especially dangerous if the
PCs encounter a lich but fail to
destroy its phylactery, for the next
time they encounter the lich, it will
likely have just the right tools to
overcome their defenses.
Lich
To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue
immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of
a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the ﬁnal step by imbibing
a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich.
While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulﬁll some long-term
plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulﬁll some malevolent
purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries
with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves
and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich’s new power.
After its metamorphosis, a lich often ﬁnds some quiet place to dwell, typically
protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich
requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals
(if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason
begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane,
further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the
more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly
puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich’s servants and guardians are absolutely
loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of
compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a
lich’s lair is a good indicator of the undead’s current mental state.
For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to
guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells
doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difﬁcult to bargain with, though the threat of
damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.
Creating A Lich
A lich can be any type of spellcaster, as long as it has the ability to perform a
ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a
spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a lich, follow these steps.
Increase the spellcaster’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Increase spell DCs and spell attack roll by 2.
LICH ABIlITIES
A lich gains the undead trait and becomes evil. Liches lose all abilities that come
from being a living creature.
A lich gains the following abilities.
Darkvision
Saving Throws +1 status bonus to all saves vs. positive
Negative Healing
Rejuvenation (arcane, necromancy) When a lich is destroyed, its soul immediately
transfers to its phylactery. A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its phylactery
is found and destroyed.
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Resistances cold 20, physical 15 (except magic bludgeoning)
Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 30
Hand of the Lich All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 negative damage
for every 3 levels and inﬂicts a paralyzing touch. This attack has the ﬁnesse trait.
Drain Phylactery Ȳ˓ Frequency once per day; Eﬀect The lich taps into its phylactery’s
power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest level the lich can cast, even if the spell
being cast is not one of the lich’s prepared spells. The lich’s phylactery doesn’t need to
be present for the lich to use this ability.
Paralyzing Touch (arcane, curse, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the
lich’s hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich’s spell DC – 4. The
creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is
paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals
the victim is alive.

LICH TREASURE
The lair of a lich is usually ﬁlled
with several magical treasures,
particularly items that the undead
can use based on its spellcasting
abilities. Scrolls, wands, and
staves are quite common,
as are books of lore and
tomes containing entirely
new spells.
AlTERNaTE LICH ABIlITIES
Although the abilities on page 220 are standard for a lich, you can create a
more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful
presence, hand of the lich, Drain Phylactery, or paralyzing touch.
Blasphemous Utterances (arcane, aura, enchantment, mental) 10 feet. The lich is
accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A
creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental eﬀects
and can’t take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10
ﬂat check. Failing this check wastes the action.
Cold Beyond Cold The lich’s hand Strike deals cold damage instead of negative, and
instead of being paralyzed, the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces
this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success).
Dark Deliverance The lich has resistance to positive equal to its level.
Siphon Life Ǻȓ Trigger The lich deals damage with its hand Strike. Eﬀect The lich regains
Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt.
Void Shroud (aura, death, necromancy) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death,
drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich’s constant hunger. Living creatures in
the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death eﬀects. In
addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition
unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich’s spell DC – 4.
Lich
A wizard whose insatiable desire for arcane power eclipsed their
mortal life, the lich is a truly devious and versatile spellcaster.
