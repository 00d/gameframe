# OFALTH
================================================================================


FILTH FLINGERS
Ofalths prefer to remain in their
middens and sewers, for in such
environs they have a constantly
renewing source of not only food,
but refuse to ﬂing at foes. An
ofalth encountered outside of
such wretched environs cannot
ﬂing rubbish as a ranged attack
unless it rips ﬁlth from its own
body. Each time it does so, it
takes 2d6 damage.
Ofalth
Found in castle dung heaps, city dumps, and sewers, ofalths are thought to be cousins
of shamblers. But whereas shamblers are living heaps of soggy vegetation, ofalths are
living heaps of matter from an altogether more unpleasant source: these monsters
look like 9-foot-tall amalgamations of wet detritus, sewage, and rubbish with long
tentacular arms and stout legs. It can be difﬁcult to tell where an ofalth’s body ends
and the foul contents of the cesspit they wallow within begins. They move through
refuse heaps in search of organic material in their endless quest to sate their hunger.
Though ofalths have a limited intellect, they still exhibit a vile curiosity. They
are no strangers to dissecting their prey after it has succumbed to their wasting
disease—a terrible and aptly named afﬂiction that causes the victim’s blood to
seep from its pores. When an ofalth manages to secure a victim alive, it may even
torture its food by consuming it bit by bit while it shrieks for mercy.
Ofalths’ domains typically overlap with those of otyughs, who fear ofalths, though
otyughs have also been known to band together in order to take down an ofalth for
its rubbery ﬂesh, which the otyughs consider an intoxicating delicacy. On the other
hand, ofalths seem to particularly enjoy taking otyughs apart one piece at a time.
They have been known to keep a captured otyugh alive for days or even weeks,
forcing the otyugh to endure the cloying scent of its own body decaying before the
ofalth feeds.

OGRE TREASURE
Ogre warrens are hideous abattoirs
strewn with severed limbs,
oﬀal, and dubious stews. Ogres
sometimes keep shiny baubles,
like jewelry, and they appreciate
intimidating weapons and armor,
especially those that are large
enough for them to use.
Ogre
Ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and
densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that
enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its
forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids—
the smaller and more beautiful, the better—ogres promise a horrifying fate for
anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity
in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize
that their playthings lack an ogre’s robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so
most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps
preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres’ playthings suffer
lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits
can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other
crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre’s limited intellect to engineer
opportunities to escape.
Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together
in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres
practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and
most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most
powerful ogre in any family is the “boss”—usually the family’s patriarch or
matriarch—while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being
brutalized by the boss’s loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins,
or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal
trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are ﬁlthy and frequently
contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.
Ogre Warrior
The simplest of ogres are slabs of muscle with hatefully beady
eyes, misshapen visages, and malformed bodies. Always eager
for mayhem and murder, ogre warriors are quick to turn on
their kin when there’s a shortage of smaller folk to torment,
so those who lead ogres do their best to keep them constantly
distracted with new opportunities for raids and ruin.

gluttons being tricked into eating razor‑edged shields or barrels
ﬁlled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of
little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole
by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table

OGRE HOOKS
Ogres are known for using
immense, curved picks called ogre
hooks. These uncommon weapons
cost 1 gp, deal 1d10 piercing
damage, have 2 Bulk, and require
two hands to use. Ogre hooks are
in the pick weapon group. Ogre
hooks have the deadly 1d10 and
trip weapon traits.
manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent
“games” that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow
manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate
the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to
afford a last-ditch escape from doom.

Ogre Boss
In ogre society, might makes more than right—it makes the rules. The
strongest or most violent ogre in a family (in most cases, this is the same
ogre) is invariably that family’s boss. Quick to hook fallen foes on their
weapons, even other ogres fear the repercussions of displeasing an ogre
boss. When an ogre boss barks out commands, the other members of the
family move quickly to obey.

OOZING ACID
Many oozes have acidic attacks
that can quickly degrade ﬂesh,
wood, and even stronger materials.
Some believe that oozes are the
result of alchemical or magical
experimentation run amok,
while others postulate that they
simply emerged from the natural
processes of evolution.
Oozes
Slimes, molds, and other oozes can be found in dank dungeons and shadowed forests.
While not necessarily evil, some grow to enormous sizes and have insatiable appetites.

1 minute (on a critical failure, the creature also falls prone). A creature can spend an Interact
action to clean someone oﬀ, decreasing the Speed penalty by 5 feet with each action.
Gelatinous Cube
Found underground or in dungeons, these quivering cubes of slime continuously scour
their domain for food. The acid in their bodies is weak enough that many gelatinous
cubes still contain the gear of their victims, as they’re unable to break them down.

metal, stone, or other inorganic substances.
Ochre Jelly
Ochre jellies are animate masses of protoplasm with a sickly combination
of yellow, orange, and brown hues. Their acidic bodies dissolve ﬂesh but
leave other materials, including a victim’s gear and bones, intact. Some

OTYUGH “PETS”
Otyughs happily wallow in and
consume the garbage of other
creatures, making them an
eﬃcient (and ecological) disposal
system for those bold enough
to try such a tack. The problem,
though, as such otyugh keepers
soon realize, is supplying enough
refuse to keep the nigh-insatiable
otyugh from wandering oﬀ from
its miasmic kennel.
Otyugh
Lords of sewers, ditches, and landﬁlls, otyughs are ﬁlthy monstrosities that stomp
about on three massive legs in search of tasty garbage and refuse. Using two barbed
tentacles to grasp and tear, guided by a third with a proliferation of eyes at the end,
the otyugh has perfectly adapted to life in its cramped, disgusting environment,
where it uses its appendages to see into tight spaces and grasp hidden prey.
Most assume that otyughs originally evolved in swamps and moved into
sewers as civilization encroached on their natural habitats. True or not, they are
now one of the larger predators in those dank environs. Otyughs are territorial,
but they have been known to form loose collectives, even giving each other
important-sounding titles like “king of offal” and “duchess of slime” to indicate
their rank and station in their sludgy underworld beneath the streets.
Those who run across an otyugh might be surprised to hear it speak, shouting
at intruders to leave its putrid home or demanding tribute in the form of trash or
other prizes of dubious nature.

VARIANT OWLBEARS
Snowy owlbears trade their
terrifying screech for amazing
stealth and the learned ability to
erupt from the snow to take prey
by surprise. Although incredibly
rare, some owlbears have retained
a limited form of ﬂight, allowing
them to glide almost 20 feet for
every foot of height descended.
Terrifyingly, these gliding
owlbears are entirely silent while
descending on their prey.
Owlbear
With the body of a powerful brown bear and the keen senses of an owl, the
owlbear is a dangerous territorial predator, fearlessly attacking any creature that
strays into its domain. Those who run afoul of an owlbear hear its terrifying
screech only seconds before the massive creature is upon them, ripping them apart
with deadly talons and a powerful beak.
Although their origin is lost to time, owlbears are assumed to be the result
of a magical experiment to make a more cunning predator. According to the
legend, the wizard was too successful and ended up being the ﬁrst victim of
the beast. Today, owlbears can be found around the world, with a variety of
features. While the most common subspecies looks like a brown bear with the
features of a great horned owl, owlbears from the frozen north might resemble
polar bears mixed with snowy owls, and in temperate rain forests they might
resemble black bears with the heads of barn owls.
Most owlbears live solitary lives, gathering only to mate and raise cubs, which
are hatched from eggs. An owlbear’s territory usually extends to around 5 miles
from its lair, with clear signs of its habitat appearing with 1 mile (clawed up
trees, gigantic feathers, and shredded carcasses). The lair of an owlbear
rarely holds anything of value, but some adventurers have found
trinkets, coins, and even jewelry in the massive pellets of undigested
bones these monsters leave behind.

CORRUPTED PEGASI
When a foul inﬂuence from the
ﬁendish planes, a necromantic
blight, or any other sinister
inﬂuence spreads through a
wilderness, pegasi can become
corrupted. These neutral evil
pegasi have the same statistics
as those presented here, but are
much more violent.
Pegasus
The pegasus is a winged horse prized for its capacity to serve as an aerial mount.
Unfortunately for those who desire a saddle-trained pegasus, pegasi are wild
creatures and do not readily accept even well-intentioned riders. Pegasi actively
resist being mounted or controlled by evil creatures, attempting to buck an
unwanted rider at every opportunity. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the
shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet.
Pegasi are highly intelligent beasts and have a strong sense of pride and
honor. The best way to entreat a pegasus is by speaking to it with grace and
offering gifts appropriate to a creature of such majesty. Prospective riders who
seek the mount for a worthy cause or virtuous quest have a much easier time
coaxing a pegasus into granting its favor. Regardless, a pegasus never accepts
a bit or saddle, for reasons both practical (a standard horse saddle
interferes with its wings) and purely egotistical.
In the wild, pegasi live in small herds and establish
territories on remote mountains where they
are relatively safe
from hunters and
slavers. They mature at the
same rate as horses and can even
breed with other equines, though the
outcome of such unions is typically a foal with
the traits of its least magical parent. On rare occasions,
the interbreeding of a pegasus and a unicorn may result in
a winged unicorn with characteristics of both parents and an
unrivaled sense of righteousness.
Some pegasi carry in them the blood of a mighty and heroic ancestor. These
champions of pegasus-kind dedicate their long lives to the pursuit of justice.
They possess powerful supernatural abilities to aid them in this ﬁght, such as
resistance to ﬁre and poison, immunity to petriﬁcation, and holy hoof attacks.
