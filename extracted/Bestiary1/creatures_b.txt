Confessor’s Aura (aura, divine, enchantment, mental) 20 feet. Creatures in the balisse’s
aura are subject to zone of truth (DC 23). Additionally, if these creatures choose to
honestly express their own conﬂicted feelings, the aura makes it easier for them to
put words to those feelings.

Brand of the Impenitent ʚʖ (curse, divine, evocation)
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect The balisse marks
an evil creature within its confessor’s aura as
irredeemable. It can only do so after a failed
attempt to convince the creature to repent. The
touched creature takes a –1 status penalty to AC
and saves, reduces its resistances by 2, and gains
weakness 2 to good damage. The duration depends on
the target’s DC 26 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The duration is 1 round.
Failure The duration is 1 day.
Critical Failure The duration is permanent.
Flaming Armament (divine, evocation) Any
weapon gains the eﬀect of a ﬂaming property
rune while a balisse wields it.
Guiding Angel Ȱɵ (divine, transmutation)
While invisible, a balisse can spiritually
attach itself to a non-evil mortal. When it
does so, it merges with the mortal’s body and
is unable to use any of its spells and abilities
other than to interact with the mortal. It must
use Guiding Angel again to leave the mortal. While
merged with the mortal, the balisse can take a form
of its choice that only the mortal can see, such as a
small angel on the mortal’s shoulder. Alternatively, it
can communicate with the mortal using a bodiless
voice only the mortal can hear.
Astral Deva (Emissary Angel)
Astral devas are the elite messengers and
emissaries of the celestial realms, serving
deities and celestial armies by delivering messages,
performing reconnaissance, and providing support for
those in need of aid. They watch over planar
travelers and take powerful mortals under
ANGELIC TREASURE
Many angels wear exquisite
armor or wield beautiful and often
magical weapons. While they are
not hampered by mortal sins like
greed or pride (save for the very
rare and tragic exception), they do
enjoy the beauty of ﬁne clothing,
exquisite jewelry, and works of art.

their wings to mentor them. Astral devas carry scrolls containing important
messages and other celestial secrets.
Astral devas can form spontaneously from the souls of exceptional
good-aligned mortals, but are also sometimes created from such souls
intentionally by deities or demigods. In the later cases, astral devas often bear
physical features that mark them as closely afﬁliated with that deity. An astral
deva created by Sarenrae, for example, might have hair made of ﬁre, while one
created by Torag might look more dwarven, and one created by Desna could
have butterﬂy wings instead of feathered wings. It’s not unusual for astral devas
created by lawful good or chaotic good deities to share their creators’ alignment.

humanoids, and the most powerful
often possess two or even four
sets of feathered wings.

MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS
All too often, those who study
stranger monsters make the
assumption that they were
created by powerful but ill-advised
wizards or are the result of ancient
manipulations from the alghollthu
empire. In the case of the baomal,
extensive research suggests that
neither of these explanations are
accurate. No ancient texts have yet
been recovered in which a wizard
claims to have created the ﬁrst
baomal. And while the alghollthu
of today use them as warbeasts,
ancient carvings suggest that in
the earliest days, baomals were
ravenous hunters of alghollthus.
Baomal
Few sea monsters are as dreaded and feared as the two-headed baomal. These
massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete with
krakens and other monsters for food. They feed on whales and other large sea
creatures, sometimes following them to the water’s surface. Near the surface,
baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty
morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships’ hulls,
then leisurely feed on the helpless sailors.

Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Double Opportunity A baomal gains an extra reaction each
round that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity.
It must use a diﬀerent head for each one it attempts, and
it can’t make more than one Attack of Opportunity for the
same triggering action.
Psychic Static Aura (aura, divination, mental, occult) 120 feet.
All creatures, except aberrations, that begin their turn in
the area take 5d6 mental damage.
Two Heads Any ability that would sever
a baomal’s head (such as a critical hit
with a vorpal weapon) severs one
head at random. Losing one head
doesn’t kill a baomal, but it does
prevent the baomal from making Strikes
with the lost head and from using Double
Opportunity or Two-Headed Strike.

Damage 4d12+18 piercing plus Improved Grab
Ranged Ȱɵ tsunami jet +38 (brutal, range 500 feet), Damage 4d10+18
bludgeoning plus Push 40 feet
Breath of the Sea Ȱɵ (attack) A baomal can inhale tremendous
amounts of water, drawing everything in the sea nearby
closer. All creatures and objects in the water within
60 feet of the baomal (including ships) are
pulled toward it. Creatures must succeed at
a DC 42 Athletics check or be pulled up to
20 feet toward the baomal (40 feet on a critical failure). For ships, use the captain’s
Sailing Lore in place of Athletics. Unattended objects are automatically pulled.
Shell Rake Ȱɵ (move) The baomal Swims or Strides alongside a creature or the hull of a
vessel, dealing damage with the strong spikes on its shell. Each creature or ship the
baomal is adjacent to at any point during its movement takes 6d6+10 slashing and
piercing damage (DC 42 basic Reﬂex save). Against vessels, Shell Rake ignores the
ﬁrst 5 Hardness and creates an explosion of splinters that deals 3d6+5 damage to
every creature within 10 feet of the deck’s edge (DC 42 basic Reﬂex save).
Two-Headed Strike ʚʖ The baomal makes a Strike with each set of jaws, each against a
diﬀerent creature. These Strikes count as one attack for the baomal’s multiple attack
penalty, and the penalty doesn’t increase until after both attacks.

Barghest
Barghests are lupine ﬁends with goblinoid faces and humanoid hands. They stalk
the Material Plane in search of souls to sate their demonic hunger. Eons ago,
barghests dwelled in the pits of Hell and served Asmodeus, but after Lamashtu
abducted and adopted the four most powerful of their kind to serve as pets (and in
time, as a pantheon of hero-gods worshipped by evil goblins), barghests’ loyalties
and philosophical nature changed signiﬁcantly. Today, while barghests retain their
connection to goblinoids, they serve none but their own appetites.
Barghest
Typical barghests are ravenous gluttons of life who feed and grow on the fat of
mortals, their bodies changing in ways none can predict as they use the ﬂesh and
blood of their victims to achieve grisly transformations into greater barghests.
Barghests often make use of their shapechanging abilities to rule tribes of
goblinoids or to discreetly hunt in rural areas in the guise of unnaturally intelligent
wolves. They do not work well together, as each barghest wants all the kills for
itself; cannibalism is the typical result of too many barghests in one small area.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation)
The barghest takes on the shape of a goblinoid (a goblin, hobgoblin,
or bugbear) or a wolf, or it transforms back into its true form. When
the barghest is a goblinoid, it loses its jaws and claw Strikes, it
becomes Small if it is a goblin, and its Speed changes to 20 feet.
When the barghest is a wolf, its Speed changes to 40 feet and
its jaws gain Knockdown. Each individual barghest has only one
goblinoid form and one wolf form.
Feed Once per month, a barghest can spend 1 minute to devour a
corpse, gaining a permanent +1 status bonus to its checks and DCs.
Each subsequent time it feeds, this bonus increases by 1. The fourth
time a barghest feeds, it sheds its skin and mutates into a greater
barghest, and the status bonus ends.
Greater Barghest
Once a barghest has eaten enough to grow into a
greater barghest, it typically seeks a method to
leave the Material Plane and return to the Abyss,
there joining other ﬁends as yet another of that
plane’s horrors. As barghests have no innate
ability to travel the planes, though, the
time it takes for most greater barghests
to engineer such a return can
usually be measured in years, if
BARGHEST HERO-GODS
The four barghests stolen from
Hell’s kennels by the deity
Lamashtu were not the originals of
their kind, but they were then and
remain today the most powerful.
Now they are denizens of the
Abyss, dwelling in their own realm
adjacent to Lamashtu’s domain,
and are heavily worshipped by
goblins across multiple worlds as
“hero-gods.” These four barghests
include Hadregash the slaver,
Venkelvore the torturer, Zarongel
the dog slayer, and Zogmugot
the scavenger.

not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of
gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few
grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the
end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make
such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new
abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.
In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests,
the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations
that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon
their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options
detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for
barghest mutations—feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with
new mutations of your own design.

As barghest.
Mutations The process of consuming corpses to
evolve into a greater barghest results in odd and
unpredictable physiological changes. A greater
barghest has one mutation, typically chosen from
the following options.
•	 Fangs (poison) The barghest grows elongated fangs
that seep poison. Its jaws deal 1d6 additional poison
damage and 1d6 persistent poison damage.
•	 Toxic Breath ʚʖ (divine, evocation, poison) The
barghest breathes a cloud of toxic gas that deals 8d6
poison damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC 25
basic Fortitude save). It can’t use Toxic Breath again for
1d4 rounds.
•	 Vestigial Arm Strike Ȳ˓ Frequency once
per round; Trigger The barghest completes
a Strike. Eﬀect The barghest makes a claw
Strike with a shriveled third arm hanging
from its torso. This attack doesn’t count for the
barghest’s multiple attack penalty, nor does
that penalty apply on
the attack.
•	 Wings The barghest
has malformed wings
extending
from
its
back. It gains a ﬂy Speed
of 25 feet.
BARGHEST CULTS
The barghest hero-gods may
be the only ones of their kind
capable of granting spells to
their clerics, but the idea of
adoring worshippers appeals to
all barghests. A barghest that
completes its transformation into
a greater barghest, and thus is no
longer morbidly distracted by its
hunger, often plays the role of a
deity to ignorant groups of goblins
or other monsters. To them, the
fact that the barghest can’t grant
spells is irrelevant—rather, their
veneration is due the fact that
worshipping the barghest is the
best way to keep it from devouring
the entire tribe.

Bat
A wide range of bats dwell throughout the world. Most of these nocturnal animals
are harmless insectivores, but deadly breeds of vampire bats and oversized bats
the size of horses pose much more signiﬁcant threats to adventurers.
Vampire Bat Swarm
Although the typical vampire bat has a wingspan of 7 inches and doesn’t pose
a signiﬁcant threat to larger prey alone (and indeed, these blood-drinkers can
feed without their sleeping victims ever noticing), some unusually aggressive
species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms. A churning cloud of vampire bats
is much more dangerous than the sum of its individual parts and is capable of
inﬂicting an overwhelming number of bleeding wounds in a frighteningly short
span of time.

Blood Feast Ȱɵ Each enemy in the bat swarm’s space takes 1d4 piercing damage (DC 16
basic Reﬂex save). Creatures that fail this save also take 1 persistent bleed damage.
Giant Bat
While big bats are certainly not uncommon in dark caves and abandoned ruins
and may instill fear in squeamish spelunkers, the so-called giant bat is a true
monster, weighing well over 100 pounds and having a wingspan of nearly 15
feet. It primarily eats fruit and bugs, but can be incited to violence through fear
or hunger. Giant bat attacks can quickly give rise to rumors
of more dangerous monsters—many mistake these massive
animals for some sort of demon or vampiric monster. But like
other bats, giant bats are simply social and intelligent mammals.
They are sometimes used as mounts by smaller humanoids,
commonly those who hail from or dwell in mountainous or
underground regions.

BAT LOCATIONS
Vampire bat swarms roost in
colonies wherever they can
ﬁnd shelter from weather, light,
and predators, favoring caves,
trees, and narrow gorges. Giant
bats prefer to dwell in smaller
numbers in deep caves, abandoned
mines, or the attics of abandoned
buildings. Even larger species
dwell in the deeper regions of
the Darklands, where they are
often used as mounts, or even
ritualistically slaughtered and then
animated as specialized undead
guardians of eerie underground
cities and nations.

DOMINION OF THE BLACK
Brain collectors typically hunt
alone, yet some adopt morbid
cults that include followers
who hope to have their own
brains harvested by these alien
invaders. The Dominion of the
Black includes a wide array of
monstrous aliens, of which the
brain collectors are merely the
most commonly encountered on
terrestrial worlds. Many of these
aliens have aﬃnities for stealing
thoughts, inhabiting bodies, or
feeding on memories—the focus
on the consumption of brains and
of identities suggesting disturbing
truths about their coalition.
Brain Collector
The grotesque brain collectors (or neh-thalggus, as they call themselves) originate
from worlds far beyond the known solar system, and are part of a conglomeration
of hostile aliens known collectively as the Dominion of the Black. Whether driven
by their own schemes or directives from sinister overlords, brain collectors arrive
in living starships to harvest the brains of intelligent creatures. These aberrations
draw no nutrition from brains, instead storing them for analysis and as vessels for
occult magical energies.
A brain collector’s form evokes that of a tailless scorpion, but the pulsing
brain-ﬁlled blisters that glisten along its back make them impossible to mistake
for merely oversized arachnids. Baleful eyes glare from the joints on their legs,
and the unsettling, intrusive whisper-thoughts they telepathically broadcast
into the minds of those they seek to feed on can be interpreted as threats or
promises alike.
Brain collectors have very little empathy for the denizens of any world they

from, as if they were gods. To brain collectors, terrestrial creatures are simply
resources for their magical needs and occult powers. They have little interest in
worshipping gods or being worshipped themselves, yet they do practice strange
forms of religion of their own, in which they consider the primordial forces of
deep space as worthy of faith and fear.

BUGBEAR LAIRS
Bugbears live in small gangs that
often prowl together, working as a
group to sow torment. They keep
their lairs in hard-to-ﬁnd places
deep in the forest or hills.
BUGBEAR TREASURE
Though bugbears don’t have much
concern for treasure, they’re prone
to keeping gruesome trophies.
Some might keep a leather cord
strung with ears from their victims,
while others collect severed ﬁngers
or noses. Bits of valuable jewelry
can sometimes remain on these
grisly prizes.
Bugbear
These stealthy and cruel goblinoid creatures delight in spreading fear and
tormenting their victims. Bugbears are the monsters lurking in the closet and
hiding under the bed. Preying on remote farmsteads, bugbears reveal their
presence with thumps in the night or creaks of boards to build lurking dread and
arouse suspicion and fear.
Bugbear Thug
The more common bugbear thug specializes in the art of lurking in the shadows.

BULETTE APPETITES
Although bulettes will eat almost
any living creature that they
can catch within their vicious
jaws, most of them have a
particular fondness for the ﬂesh
of halﬂings or horses. Lacking
other food, a bulette might gnaw
upon vegetable matter or even
inanimate objects, although they
don’t gain actual nourishment from
doing so, this need to feed being
merely an extension of a deeply
compelling instinct.
Bulette
Bulettes are fearsome predators that roam just beneath the surface of desolate
wilderness areas. When they burrow through the ground, only the ﬁn of their
thickly armored backs protrudes above—at least until they are ready to leap out
and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal ﬁn have earned
the nickname “landshark.”
A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles.
When it ﬁnds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that
area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe
entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are ﬁercely competitive creatures that
battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid
contact or conﬂict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate.
Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life—a mated pair of bulettes being
the only known exception to the creature’s penchant for solitude. They rear
their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young
bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill
and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its
ﬁrst successful hunt.
The ﬁrst bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as
frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for
their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history,
and multiple conﬂicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards
claiming to have been the ﬁrst inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages
postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf—a theory born out
of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature,
seem to ﬁnd elf ﬂesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a
bulette’s path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder,
simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.

are never a favored prey for bulettes.
Leaping Charge ʚʖ The bulette attempts a
High Jump or Long Jump. If it’s adjacent to an
enemy at the apex of its High Jump or at the end of
its Long Jump, it can make a claw Strike against the
enemy at that moment. If the bulette jumps at least
5 feet vertically or at least 20 feet horizontally, it can
attempt two claw Strikes instead of one. The bulette’s
multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until it
has made all the claw Strikes that are part of its
Leaping Charge.
Powerful Jumper A bulette jumps 10 feet up on a
successful High Jump, or 20 feet up on a critical success.

BUNYIP TREASURE
Bunyips have no use for treasure,
and do not actively collect it,
but the ﬂoors of their lairs are
sometimes littered with the
possessions of their humanoid
victims. A bunyip’s teeth can be
collected and sold (most bunyips
have about 50 teeth at any one
time). Alternatively, due to their
elusiveness and fabled nature, a
high-quality taxidermic bunyip
could easily command a high price
from a collector.
Bunyip
Bunyips are dangerous aquatic predators that resemble a cross between a shark
and a seal. Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips
hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents
and ﬁsherfolk.
Despite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with
loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted
by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years,
bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now
that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular
bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited
shapechanging abilities are no doubt a signiﬁcant part of the reason for this air of
mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids,
preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except
when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point
the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree
that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the
result of unreported bunyip aggression.
In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the
chum and garbage discarded by ﬁshing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk
close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and
small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms
hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.

doesn’t deal the 1d6 persistent bleed damage. It can choose to gain
either a long snake tail, granting its tail Strike reach 10 feet and Grab, or
squat crocodile legs, increasing its land Speed to 20 feet. If it uses Shift Form
again, the bunyip can return to normal or switch between a long tail or crocodile legs.

CALIGNI TREASURE
Many calignis hide shiny
baubles and trinkets beneath
their dark rags, keeping them
out of sight of their greedy kin.
They also keep several doses of
black smear poison on hand to
incapacitate foes.
Caligni
Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, creeping to the surface to steal, stalk, or make
mischief. Each caligni serves in a speciﬁc role and grows into a speciﬁc form as
determined by supernatural traditions and inﬂuences in caligni society. Regardless
of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale ﬂesh and white eyes. Some
surface dwellers call the caligni “dark folk,” a term they dislike because it doesn’t
reﬂect either their appearance or character, only their environment.

Caligni dancers serve as intermediaries between caligni clans.

THE SUN! IT BURNS!
Deros are ﬁxated with curing their
allergy to sunlight. To understand
how the surface dwellers can
withstand the light of the sun,
deros conduct late-night raids on
surface cities, abducting victims and
performing terrible experiments on
them. Those who survive are often
returned with much of their memory
erased and their bodies bearing
mysterious scars. When these
repressed memories surface, they
lead to wild, hazy recollections of
being abducted.
Dero
Deros are short, wiry humanoids with milky white eyes, gray-blue skin,
and wild shocks of off-white or gray hair. The descendants of a mysterious
type of fey abandoned in the deepest, darkest caverns of Golarion, deros are
the subject of fearful legends and folk tales to most of the world’s surface
races. They skulk beneath major metropolitan areas, performing cruel and
twisted experiments on unwilling subjects. A dero is 3 feet tall and weighs
approximately 70 pounds.

DIABOLIC LOCATIONS
The nine layers of Hell are the
planar home of all devils, and
they much prefer its tyrannically
ordered environs to anywhere else
in the multiverse. Yet devils can
be encountered anywhere mortals
can be tempted by infernal
bargains or seek diabolic aid. On
Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is
particularly aligned with Hell. Its
government is based upon Hellʼs
organization, and the state church
is that of Asmodeus.
Erinys (Fury Devil)
Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature’s crimes, torturing
and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape
of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the ﬁrst erinyes shared
that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser
devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of
torturers and persecutors. The erinyes’ origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a
fallen angel and one of Hell’s most powerful demigods. The ﬁrst erinyes were all
considered to be Eiseth’s metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that
time are no longer limited to a single gender.

Furious Fusillade ̂ˬ The erinys hovers in place if they are
ﬂying and ﬁres one arrow at any number of creatures in a
30‑foot cone. Each attack is rolled separately. This counts as
one attack for the purpose of the erinys’s multiple attack penalty.
Rope Snare An erinys carries a coil of rope woven of their hair (use
the statistics for rope) that animates in their hands. When a creature is
hit by the erinys’s rope, a segment of the rope tears loose and wraps itself
around the creature, imposing a 10–foot circumstance penalty to Speed. The
piece that tears oﬀ is 10 feet long for a Medium or smaller creature, and doubles in
length for each size larger than Medium. When a creature Escapes the eﬀect (DC 26),
the detached segment of rope withers away into useless black sludge.
Phistophilus (Contract Devil)
Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely found outside
the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential contracts,
tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their worldly
desires. If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts for

exceptional balance. Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other
than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim’s ﬂesh with
their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long.
As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to
take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully
train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous
beasts with a steady diet of meat.
Some tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of
primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of
war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs
as part of executions or ritual sacriﬁces. Some xulgath cults even revere
tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods. For their
part, tyrannosaurs who have grown used to having their meals provided in
this manner are remarkably well-behaved toward their feeders and keepers.
Tyrannosauruses are 50 feet long and weigh 7 tons or more.
Other variants of the tyrannosaurs include slightly smaller dinosaurs such
as the allosaurus, or even larger dinosaurs like the ravenous giganotosaurus.
Even the smallest tyrannosaurs, such as the nanotyrannus, are never smaller
than Large in size, yet despite this smaller stature, they are no less ferocious,
and those who would assume that a nanotyrannus is "safer" to train would
do well to think again!

Requirements
A
creature
is
Grabbed
in
the
tyrannosaurus’s
jaws.
Eﬀect The tyrannosaurus ﬂings the creature into the air
up to 10 feet up from its mouth and 20 feet away. The
creature falls 25 feet (assuming the tyrannosaurus
ﬂings it as high as it can) and takes falling damage
accordingly. If the ﬂung creature lands on another
creature, the creature it lands on takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage. The
creature being landed on can attempt a DC 23 basic Reﬂex save.
Pin Prey Ǻȓ Trigger The tyrannosaurus critically hits a Large or smaller foe with its
foot. Effect The creature struck by the foot is knocked prone and the tyrannosaurus
uses its foot to hold the creature in place. As long as the tyrannosaurus doesn’t
move from its position, the pinned creature is Grabbed. A tyrannosaurus gains
a +2 circumstance bonus to attack a creature it has pinned in this manner, but
it cannot use Swallow Whole on the target unless it uses its jaws to Grab the
victim first.

MEGAFAUNA MOUNTS
Orcs are known for riding strange
and fearsome beasts, particularly
megafauna like dire wolves
(page 334) and smilodons (page
53). Given the opportunity, orcs
also enlist drakes, manticores, and
anything else big and frightening
enough to suit their needs.
Orc
Orcs are violent, monstrous humanoids that live by the rule that might makes
right. They amass in brutal warbands both large and small, decimating and
robbing those unlucky enough to cross their path. Countless small settlements,
outposts, and forts have fallen at the hands of orc raiders, whose fecundity and
sheer destructiveness leave an indelible mark on the lands they conquer. Survivors
of orc invasions are as likely to be fed to the orcs’ war beasts as they are to be
taken as slaves. Unspeakable atrocities await any outsiders brought back to orc
encampments, and to many, death is a far more preferable outcome compared to
capture by orcs.
Physically, orcs tower over most humanoids and look practically
custom-made for violence with their rough ﬂesh, sturdy bone, and iron‑hard
muscle. For all their tough looks, however, orcs are far from invincible.
They lack the discipline to conduct large-scale campaigns, for one thing,
and they typically lose their heads in the heat of battle. Even their skin scars
easily—though this is a source of pride to the orc people, since scars signify
strength and experience in battle. To orcs, the crisscross of old wounds are a
much a badge of pride and honor as any beheaded foe or claimed trophy.
Orcs are a people of violent passions in all that they do, not just war. Bonds
of blood are especially strong among orcs,
and lineage is important. The strongest
orc bands are typically made up of
brothers and sisters in more than
arms; orcs ﬁght harder when they
are protecting their own kinsfolk, and
orc warriors will ﬁght tirelessly to avenge fallen
family members. This emphasis on bloodlines is not
an altruistic one, however, and is in fact a double-edged
sword. Orcs whose families have been killed ﬁnd themselves
at the bottom of the clan’s totem pole, and even a famous
chieftain can become powerless overnight if their brethren aren’t there to
back them up.
The chaotic and fractious nature of orc culture results in a great
variety of beliefs, superstitions, and legacies among different clans. This
cultural divergence causes substantial inﬁghting among orc bands,
in many cases preventing the rise of larger orc nations. It can also
frustrate many attempts at diplomacy, as the taboos of one band
may be commonplace and thoroughly accepted practices among
others. Navigating a speciﬁc band’s culture can often mean the
difference between life and death to those who deal with
orcs off the ﬁeld of war. Although orcs, as a rule, rarely
deal with outsiders, they recognize the beneﬁts of trade
and willingly swap resources with other violent peoples
like hobgoblins, drow, and many humans.
Orc Brute
If orc armies are rarely well organized, this shortcoming can
likely be traced to the furious and undisciplined rank-and-ﬁle
brutes who make up the bulk of an orc warband.

SNAKES IN MYTHOLOGY
Snakes appear frequently
and prominently in the myths
and legends of many cultures
throughout the Inner Sea region.
In Ancient Osirion, snakes were
revered and associated both with
the evil serpent god Apep and the
good goddess Wadjet, the Green
Empress. Perhaps the best-known
example of snakes in Golarion’s
legends are the serpentfolk—
serpentine humanoids who ruled
vast swaths of the world in
prehistoric times and worshipped a
foul snake deity called Ydersius.
Giant Viper
The giant viper’s fangs are a frightening sight, with injection tubes as long as
daggers. The sheer amount of venom injected by a giant viper can cause severe
blood clotting and leave a victim utterly drained of vitality.

Giant Anaconda
The monstrous giant anaconda is capable of swallowing whole creatures as
big as horses—to say nothing of their riders. Although novice bushwhackers
watch out for snakes that might drop on them from the jungle canopy above,
giant anacondas are most commonly encountered in ponds and rivers, where
they feed on prey including manatees and capybaras.
