DEMONIC DEITIES
The most powerful demons are
known as demon lords (the term
is gender neutral in this case).
Of these divinities, Lamashtu is
the most powerful. Countless
other demon lords exist, including
Abraxas, Cyth-V’sug, Kabriri,
and Zura.
Demon
When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a
deadly ﬁend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic
sins like wrath or gluttony, or more “specialized” depravities like an obsession
with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon’s driving
goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal
souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a neverending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Abyss.
Quasit
Unlike other demons, quasits are formed when a mortal spellcaster sheds a portion
of their own sinful soul to create a familiar or companion. When these quasits outlive
their creators, they become free willed and seek methods of returning to the Abyss,
a task that requires pledging servitude to more powerful demons, so many quasits
instead opt to remain on the Material Plane to promote evil and hope for chance and
luck to someday provide them with a method of reaching the Abyss on their own.

THE NATURE OF CHAOS
Some say that the nature of chaos
inherently precludes cooperation
and subtlety, but demons are
proof of the fallacy of this claim.
Succubus (Lust Demon)
Succubi are manifestations of the sin of destructive lust, and they are the most
attractive of all demons—as beﬁts their role in seducing mortals to fall to sin. The
concept of gender is ﬂuid to a succubus, as they can adopt countless humanoid
forms of any gender to aid in their goals. Most succubi have a feminine true form
(incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a different kind of demon),
but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally beautiful or handsome,
but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous tail.
When disguised as a mortal humanoid on the Material Plane, a succubus
whispers into the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and
most destructive desires and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if
persuasion fails. While mortals often ﬁxate on succubi’s application of sexual
lust, these demons are can easily exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or
any other desire as easily as more carnal appetites. Their ability to inﬁltrate
societies makes them excellent spies, assassins, and political saboteurs as
well. Ultimately, the succubus enjoys all means of upending mortal culture.

MONSTROUS ELEMENTALS
Some elementals are more than
living incarnations of air, earth,
ﬁre, or water. Creatures like the
genie (pages 162–165), the uthul
(page 317), or the zaramuun (page
339) have their own complex
ecologies and societies. While
these creatures originally hail
from an Elemental Plane, they can
often be found on the Material
Plane as well.

Quetzalcoatlus
Quetzalcoatlus are the largest ﬂying members of the
pterosaur family and are often mistaken for dragons due
to their immense size and 40-foot wingspans.
Quetzalcoatlus are carnivorous, feeding on a variety
of reptiles, mammals, large ﬁsh, amphibians, and other
invertebrates. They are not inherently aggressive
creatures and are happy to scavenge for food, but
when presented with live prey they readily attack
almost any creature smaller than themselves.

OTHER QUELAUNTS
Perhaps the most frightening tales
of quelaunts attribute them with
abilities beyond those detailed
here, suggesting that quelaunts
might be an entire category
of alien menace that has only
recently turned its awful attention
to humanity.
Quelaunt
This three-armed, three-legged monster has no discernible eyes, nose, ears, or mouth
or no visible means of ingesting food. Its limbs are distributed so evenly across its
body that it is all but impossible to tell which way the creature is oriented at any
given time. Few who witness the quelaunt linger on its alien looks for long though,
as the most pressing concern quickly becomes the invasion of their minds, as the
quelaunt sows doubt, sorrow, and rage. This monstrosity not only delights in the
negative emotions of its prey, but feeds on them, gaining strength and sustenance
from their dismay. For the quelaunt, no act is too terrible or cruel to inﬂict on its
victims, since the more a creature suffers, the more the quelaunt feasts.
Quelaunts are known to associate with other aberrant horrors, including brain
collectors and other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. However,
the more prevalent theory paints them as more alien—perhaps invasive beings from
another dimension of pure thought and feeling—and claims that in their natural
state they have no physical bodies at all. Few dare speculate further; the only known
autopsy of a quelaunt resulted in the researcher’s suicide just days afterward and all
the notes were mysteriously destroyed. Whatever secrets
there are to be unlocked in the anatomy of these bizarre
monsters are apparently important enough to warrant
great protection from quelaunts, even after death.

Emotional Focus The quelaunt can cast the following cleric domain spells as 8th-level
occult innate spells at will without spending Focus Points: blind ambition (Core
Rulebook 389), captivating adoration (Core Rulebook 389), and delusional pride
(Core Rulebook 391).
Emotional Frenzy ̂ˬ The quelaunt casts up to three spells chosen from its
at-will innate spells and its emotional focus spells.
Feed on Emotion Ȱɵ (attack, emotion, incapacitation, mental); Frequency once per
round; Eﬀect The quelaunt feeds on the emotional unrest of a single creature
within 30 feet that’s under a harmful emotion eﬀect. The target must succeed
at a DC 37 Will save or take 4d10 mental damage and be stunned for
1 round. If the target fails its saving throw, the quelaunt regains the same
number of Hit Points and Feed on Emotion does not cost the quelaunt an
action, allowing it to use another action this turn.

2nd hideous laughter; Constant (4th) air walk
Rapid Strikes ʚʖ (attack) The quelaunt makes three melee Strikes, each
against a diﬀerent target within reach. The multiple attack penalty
applies to each attack, but increases only after all the
attacks have been made.
Spiral of Despair Ȳ˓ (emotion, mental); Trigger A
creature fails a saving throw to resist one of the quelaunt's innate spells or emotional
focus spells. Eﬀect As the quelaunt invades the triggering creature's mind and plants
the seeds of negative emotions, it also strips away the target’s feelings of hope or
positivity. The quelaunt can immediately end a single emotion eﬀect
from which the triggering creature is beneﬁting.

RAKSHASA IMMORTALS
Above all rakshasas rule the
rakshasa immortals, powerful
unique entities who deem
themselves deities. These beings
include Aksha of the Second
Breath, Bundha the Singing
Butcher, Dradjit the Godslayer,
Kunkarna the Dream Warrior,
Mursha the Beastmaster,
Otikaya the Spirit Archer,
Surpa the Avenger,
Zabha the Desecrator,
and untold others.
Rakshasa
Rakshasas are evil spirits that cloak themselves in the guises of humanoid
creatures, that they might walk unseen among their prey. They embody what
is taboo among most societies, and in the shape of those they seek to deﬁle,
rakshasas gorge themselves on these hideous acts. A wide range of rakshasas
exist; presented below are the diminutive, sinister dandasuka rakshasa and the
infamous raja rakshasa, who are the most widespread and commonly encountered
of these ﬁends.
Dandasuka
Known as “biters” among the more powerful rakshasa castes, dandasukas serve
as spies and assassins for rakshasa clans or powerful spellcasters who have
found methods to bind one of these ﬁends to their will. Born to manipulate and
murder, these half-sized terrors revel in their work and delight in the sight of
blood. They often dress in extravagant clothes dyed with ostentatious colors
and wear numerous elaborate accessories, whether in their true form or in
disguise as human children, halﬂing merchants, or anything else that helps them
blend into their targeted society.
A dandasuka rakshasa is constantly haunted by a monstrous hunger that
gnaws at its hyperactive body, forcing it to feed often. In combat, a dandasuka
might pause to lick a bloody blade or lap at a pool of spilled blood on the ﬂoor.
These creatures settle for other meat when they must, but much prefer the taste
of mortal humanoid ﬂesh. Regular offers of such victuals can keep a dandasuka
loyal to anyone willing to provide frequent meals, but care must be taken in
keeping a dandasuka, for many stories tell of them being overly eager to serve
an adored benefactor, taking off-hand remarks too literally, and
performing services of violence that were never intended.
