Gestalt ̂ˬ (concentrate, divine, transmutation) Nine lantern
archons can use this activity, all within 1 round of the ﬁrst, to merge together to form
a composite being for 7 rounds that appears as a glowing warrior of light. The gestalt

and so on) but the spells and special abilities of a lantern archon. Additionally, it has
a ranged light ray Strike (+18 attack, Damage 3d4 ﬁre and 3d4 good), and the bonus
from its Lantern of Hope increases to +3. When the gestalt separates, its remaining
Hit Points are divided evenly among the lantern archons, and if the gestalt had fewer
than 9 HP, some of the lantern archons die.
Lantern of Hope Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, mental) The lantern archon
shines as a beacon of hope. Good allies within 30 feet gain a +1 status bonus to
damage rolls and to saving throws against crushing despair.

ARCHON LOCATIONS
While commonly found in Heaven,
archons can also be encountered
on the ﬁendish planes in their
endless crusade against evil. On
the Material Plane they are usually
encountered as advisors or saviors
to those in need.
Horned Archon
Horned archons are secretive and tireless sentinels and scouts, patrolling the Outer
Sphere’s untamed wilds for evil to eliminate and keeping small communities safe from
demons, devils, and worse. They resemble muscular humans with the head, horns,
and legs of a stag. When requested to do so by their patrons, especially Erastil, they
journey to the Material Plane and patrol dangerous frontier areas, secretly performing
acts of kindness such as leading hunters to food, helping lost children, and driving off
evil creatures. Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana and Elysium, horned archons
are among the best at understanding the perspectives of other celestials.

Menacing Guardian (aura, divine, enchantment) 30 feet. Enemies that start their
turn in the area or enter it must attempt a DC 19 Will save. On a failure, they
take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls, spell rolls, and damage rolls against
any other target while in the aura for 24 hours or until they damage the archon,
whichever comes ﬁrst. On a critical failure, they can’t use hostile actions
against any other target while in the area for 24 hours or until they
damage the archon, whichever comes ﬁrst. Regardless of the
result, a creature is then temporarily immune to further
menacing guardian auras for 24 hours.
Retributive Strike Ǻȓ A horned archon can also make a
Retributive Strike with its composite longbow.
Speed 35 feet
Melee Ȱɵ horn +11 (magical), Damage 2d8+3

Archon’s Door Once per day, if an archon sees another
creature cast dimension door, it can cast an innate
dimension door (heightened to 5th level) within 1 round
to attempt to follow that creature to the maximum distance
of the archon’s dimension door. If the archon’s dimension
door has enough distance, the archon appears the same
distance and direction from the creature as before
either used dimension door.
Touch of Charity Ȱɵ (healing, manipulate,
necromancy) A horned archon can touch
another creature to take on that creature’s
wounds, transferring up to 30 of the
horned archon’s HP to the touched
creature.
The
horned
archon
can’t transfer more HP than it
currently has.

OTHER ARCHONS
Many other archons than those
presented here patrol Heaven or
crusade in the ﬁendish planes,
including the resolute hound
archon soldiers and sentinels,
and the supreme bastion archons,
who rank among Heaven’s most
powerful defenders.
Shield Archon
Shield archons defend the fortresses of Heaven against ﬁendish incursions. They
wield their spears and shields in massive formations capable of withstanding any
onslaught. Beneath their armor, they are sheathed in skin of steel. Given their
tremendous strength and imposing stature, shield archons are ideal guardians
of the meek and are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane to ward off the
attacks of great numbers of evildoers.

Items +1 full plate
Morphic Hands Ȱɵ (divine, transmutation) A shield archon’s hands can change
into a +1 holy striking spear and a lesser sturdy shield or
back into hands. Transforming does not restore any
HP to the items, and if either the weapon or shield
is fully destroyed, the archon loses that hand until
it receives a regenerate spell or similar magic. If a
shield archon is slain, its weapon and shield can
be taken, but they fade into nothingness after
24 hours.
AC 31 (33 with shield raised); Fort +23, Ref +15,
Will +19; +1 status to all saves vs. magic
HP 125; Weaknesses evil 10
Living Shield A shield archon’s shield is the focal
point of its courage and soul. It always has
its shield raised without needing to Raise a
Shield, and it can use Shield Block as a free
action instead of a reaction (Hardness 10,
HP 80). A shield archon can trigger its Shield
Block free action when an ally within 10 feet
is the target of an attack, reducing damage
to that ally instead of itself but otherwise
following the normal rules of Shield Block.
Menacing Guardian (aura, divine, enchantment)

Archon’s Door As horned archon.
Courageous Switch When a shield archon
uses its dimension door innate spell, it
can choose to move into the space of
a willing ally it can see within range.
If it does so, the ally switches places
with the archon, appearing in the
space the archon just vacated, as if
it too had cast dimension door.

WANDERING AZATAS
While the idyllic realm of Elysium
is the home plane of azatas, their
overwhelming curiosity and
natural wanderlust often lead
them to travel far from this plane.
On other planes, they can be
seeking to right wrongs, looking
for entertainment, or merely
exploring to see the sights. More
than a few azatas, taken by a
whimsical urge to spread their
sometimes unwelcome jocosity,
see it as their duty to tease uptight
or humorless mortal creatures.
Gancanagh (Passion Azata)
Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments of
free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but earnest
ﬂings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve Cayden
Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium
who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings
that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the
demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love.
One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a
creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed
paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy
drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can’t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many
gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes
them look dapper. They cherish their silver ﬂutes, for they enjoy the beauty of
ﬂutes’ music and its ability to sway the heart.
The majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of
gender to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely,
is much more ﬂuid and open to interpretation than for many mortals.
Gancanaghs enjoy using this ﬂexibility to confront and test mortals’
convictions when faced with fear or prejudice, but when encountering
mortals who themselves are open-minded about sexuality or gender identity,
they can become lifelong allies. For those who are persecuted for such reasons,
gancanaghs are tireless defenders and eager supporters, quick to provide safety
and to punish those who would attempt to impose narrower beliefs upon a
world that deserves more diversity than it often gets. If possible, a gancanagh
seeks to educate and redeem those who hold destructive beliefs or prejudices,
resorting to combat only to defend themself or an endangered mortal, or when
no other option seems tenable—yet even then, they ﬁght with sadness.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The gancanagh
can take on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t
change their Speed or their attack and damage bonuses with their Strikes, but
might change the damage type their Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Invigorating Passion ʚʖ (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) The gancanagh
embraces or kisses a willing creature, infusing that creature with their
invigorating passion. The creature gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls
and 10 temporary Hit Points for 10 minutes. After that time, the target
becomes fatigued for 10 minutes unless they succeed at a DC 21
Fortitude save.

OTHER AZATAS
The wilds of Elysium play host
to a wide array of azatas, the
most varied and widespread of
the celestials. From the four-
eyed mothlike uinuja to the
supernaturally verdant and
beautiful veranallia, whose lower
body is a wondrous garden of
wildﬂowers and plant life, azatas
are nothing if not diverse!
Ghaele (Crusader Azata)
Ghaeles are ﬁend-hunting knights of Elysium and champions of the freedom to take
up arms against oppressors and other evils. Ghaeles rarely engage directly in mortal
wars, but where ﬁends are involved they make an exception. A ghaele might assume
the guise of a mortal to ﬁght ﬁends alongside others, hoping to bolster morale and
teach good tactics against such supernatural foes. Ghaeles serve various deities and
empyreal lords of Elysium, though many have an afﬁnity for Cayden Cailean in
his capacity as a champion of freedom and defender of the downtrodden. Among
azatas, ghaeles are generally the quickest to shift to violence as a method of solving
problems, but even then they seek to minimize pain and suffering when they can.

Free Blade Ȳ˓ Trigger The ghaele ends its turn while unable to act or
attempts a greatsword Strike that would take a circumstance or
status penalty. Eﬀect A ghaele’s blade is implacable in the pursuit
of freedom, and its energies can overpower any eﬀect that would
interfere with its swordplay. The ghaele attempts to counteract
each eﬀect that prevents it from making a greatsword Strike, gives
it a penalty to its greatsword Strike, or prevents it from acting. The
ghaele can use this ability even if it’s otherwise unable to act.
Light Form A ghaele’s body is partially corporeal and partially composed
of light, with a color corresponding to the elemental energy currently
residing in its blade (see Choose Weakness). It can move through solid
objects but can’t end its action within a solid object.

Divine Rituals DC 33; resurrect
Choose Weakness Ȱɵ (concentrate, divination, divine, evocation, manipulate) A
ghaele attempts to Recall Knowledge about a foe it is facing. If successful, it
can change the elemental damage dealt by its greatsword and light ray to acid,
cold, electricity, ﬁre, or sonic, usually to match the a foe’s weakness. It can also
change its energy resistance to any of these energy types (this can be a diﬀerent
type than for its attacks). The choices remain until it next uses Choose Weakness.
Ghaele’s Gaze Ȱɵ (divine, evocation, visual) When a ghaele ﬁxes its gaze upon a non-good
creature, the creature suﬀers the eﬀects of divine decree (DC 33 Will save). If it survives,
the creature is temporarily immune to Ghaele’s Gaze for 1 minute.
Holy Blade (divine, evocation) Any weapon becomes a +2 holy striking weapon
while the ghaele wields it.

CAT LOCATIONS
Leopards are exceptionally
adaptable, able to survive in any
grassland, forest, or jungle, and
even the fringes of deserts.
Lions live in grassy plains
and savannas, although species
adapted for temperate environs
that dwell in mountains exist as
well. Male mountain lions lack
the mane of their somewhat
larger grassland-dwelling kin,
but are no less dangerous.
While tigers are most common
in forests, they also inhabit
grasslands and savannas as long
as vegetation is dense, and their
dens are often found in caves.
Smilodons live in wooded
and grassland areas.

HP 240; Immunities death eﬀects, negative; Weaknesses good 15
Soul Siphon (aura, divine, force, necromancy) 30 feet. An astradaemon draws power
from the souls of the recently slain. If a Small or larger living creature dies within its
aura, the astradaemon gains 5 temporary Hit Points and a +1 status bonus to attack
and damage rolls for 1 round, unless the creature was slain by an astradaemon’s
Devour Soul ability. Incorporeal undead and living spirits traveling outside the
body take 1d8 force damage each round within the daemon’s aura from
the spiritual pressure as the astradaemon pulls in fragments of their soul.
Displacement (divine, illusion, visual) An astradaemon bends light, appearing
shifted from its true position, though still in the same space. Creatures
targeting the astradaemon must attempt a DC 11 ﬂat check, as if the
astradaemon were hidden, even though it remains observed. Eﬀects such as the
Blind-Fight feat and halﬂing’s keen eyes that apply on the ﬂat check against
hidden creatures also apply against a displaced astradaemon.

Ȱɵ
(divine,
incapacitation,

hasn’t used an action with the attack trait yet
this turn. Eﬀect The astradaemon draws out
and consumes the soul of a living creature it
has grabbed. The creature must succeed at
a DC 35 Fortitude save or instantly die. If it
dies, the astradaemon gains 10 temporary
Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to attack
and damage rolls for 1 minute, or for 1
day if the victim was 15th level or higher.
A victim slain in this way can be returned
to life normally. A creature that survives is
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Essence Drain (divine, necromancy, negative) When an
astradaemon hits with its claw, jaws, or tail, it drains the target’s spiritual and
vital essences. The target takes 2d10 negative energy damage and the astradaemon
regains an equal number of Hit Points. The target must succeed at a DC
37 Fortitude save or become doomed 1 and drained 1. If
the target was already drained or doomed, it instead
increases both conditions’ value by 1, to a maximum
of 4.
OTHER DAEMONS
As many daemons exist as there
are awful ways to die. The bloody
sangudaemon personiﬁes death
by blood loss, while the skeletal
thanadaemon represents death
from old age. The most powerful
daemons are the olethrodaemons,
who represent the massive deaths
caused by apocalypses and the end
of entire worlds.

ARCHDEVILS
At any one time, eight archdevils
rule the eight upper layers of Hell,
while the deepest layer is ruled
by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a
unique demigod with a dedicated
role in guiding the infernal machine
forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden
of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while
Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city.
Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries,
and Belial designs new weapons
for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the
oldest archdevil and keeper of many
secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs
armies. Baalzebul is a brooding
archdevil who has fallen from
Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty
Mephistopheles was formed from
the plane of Hell itself.
Imp
Imps are inﬁltrators and corruptors who, despite their diminutive stature, are
more than capable of subtly inﬂuencing a weak-willed individual into performing
increasingly evil acts over time. An imp will often agree to serve a mortal and
act docile and loyal in a long-term plot to eventually damn its master’s soul to
Hell. Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal souls, and
thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them leeway to
pursue their specialties. Despite standing a mere 2-feet tall, imps can be vicious
combatants, ﬂying out of reach and turning invisible to escape should the odds
turn against them.

MONSTROUS ELEMENTALS
Some elementals are more than
living incarnations of air, earth,
ﬁre, or water. Creatures like the
genie (pages 162–165), the uthul
(page 317), or the zaramuun (page
339) have their own complex
ecologies and societies. While
these creatures originally hail
from an Elemental Plane, they can
often be found on the Material

ELDRITCH GODS
Gugs don’t traditionally make
religion and faith a key part of
their society, but gug cities always
feature prominent temples to
obscure gods whose faith has
passed from view on most mortal
worlds. Most gugs certainly know
of entities such as Azathoth,
Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth,
but even among gugs, these
Outer Gods are more feared and
respected than prayed to.
Gug
A gug’s most horrid feature is its barrel-shaped head, which splits vertically to
reveal numerous rows of sharp, yellow teeth and an open throat. Its eyes on
either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the
frantic ﬂailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi
and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair
of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with
shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.
Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs
lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark
nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most
gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims
and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed
paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked
with strange runes and sacriﬁced to the gugs’ wicked
gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors
tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of
stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders
preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.
Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which
seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean
world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them;
however, this strange fear doesn’t apply to ghasts, whom gugs
consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.
Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds,
although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies
their immense size. Their light step and ability
to squeeze through very small crannies makes
gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange
disappearances or bloody massacres.
Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain
awful powers as gifts from their eldritch
patrons. These monsters are known as savants,
are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells.
Though each savant’s precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant
invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and
destructive energies upon living ﬂesh.

Furious Claws ʚʖ The gug makes up to four claw Strikes, each against a diﬀerent
target. These attacks all count toward the gug’s multiple attack penalty, but the
penalty doesn’t increase until after the gug makes all its attacks.

a lamia matriarch’s lower body is formed in the winding coils of a giant
snake. They’re also set apart by the occult power they pursue, and some have
even have grand designs to break the animalistic curse that transformed

ASSOCIATED MONSTERS
Because of their relative frailty,
leaf leshys frequently act as
liaisons and call upon more
powerful forest guardians when
their domains are threatened.
Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly
fey may respond to the call of a
leaf leshy, as do arboreals and
other plant creatures.
Leshy
Leshys are intelligent plant creatures that guard areas of primeval wilderness or
earthly power. Originally created by powerful fey, they manifest when a skilled
practitioner of primal magic—typically a druid—combines a nature spirit with
a body carefully grown from local vegetation. The rites and materials required
to create a leshy vary depending on the type of leshy. They are typically given
life in an area of great natural signiﬁcance, such as an arboreal’s grove, a druidic
circle, a fairy ring, or a great natural wonder.
Leaf Leshy
Leaf leshys are diminutive protectors of forests clad in pine cone armor and hats
of fruit, ﬂowers, or leaves. They enjoy mock battles but act cautiously in real ones.

Glide Ȱɵ (move) The leshy glides gently through the air, moving
5 feet toward the ground and up to 25 feet forward. As long
as the leshy spends at least 1 action gliding each round, it
remains in the air at the end of each turn. For the purpose of
determining damage from falls, a leaf leshy always treats falls
as if they were 20 feet shorter.
Gourd Leshy
Gourd leshys are guardians of ﬁelds, gardens, and
farms. Many villages beneﬁt from the protection of a

UNIQUE LICHDOM
The exact ritual, ingredients
for deadly concoctions, and
magical conditions required to
become a lich are unique and
diﬀerent for every living creature.
Understanding a spellcaster’s path
to lichdom can help, but is no
guarantee of success for others.
LICH PHYLACTERY
ITEM 12
RARE
ARCANE
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Price 1,600 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
This item is crafted by a spellcaster who wishes to become a lich. When a lich is
destroyed, its soul ﬂees to the phylactery. The phylactery then rebuilds the lich’s undead
body over the course of 1d10 days. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the phylactery,
fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body).
A lich’s phylactery must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning.
The standard phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment inscribed
with magical phrases. This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more
durable or diﬃcult-to-obtain phylacteries. A phylactery might also come in the form of a
ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the speciﬁcs are up to the creator.
Demilich
Demiliches are formed when a lich, through carelessness or by accident, loses its
phylactery. As years pass, the lich’s body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull
as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left
wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses
the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form.
Negative energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and
teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull,
embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic,
forms a creature called a demilich.
Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time
to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich’s
hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power
in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich’s
skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some
theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the
demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is ﬁnally free to wander the
planes and ﬁnd new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the
Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear
in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.

concealed. Any creature other than the demilich that enters or begins its turn in
the aura takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage.

Iruxis are, as a general rule,
quite religious. Those who
venerate deities typically look to
Gozreh, but some of them ﬁnd
the teachings of Desna to be
compelling. Most iruxis, though,
instead follow druidic traditions,
ancestor worship, and astrological
philosophies in particular.
Lizardfolk Scout
Iruxi scouts are the lizardfolk most often encountered by adventurers, for
these explorers and hunters spend most of their lives on the move, constantly
patrolling the territories held by their enclave. If intruders are driven off, it is the
responsibility of the iruxi scouts to track them, observe them, and learn their ways
and weaknesses so as to report back to the community and aid in the defense
against potential reprisals.

MANTICORE TREASURE
A manticore enjoys taking plunder
from the corpses of its prey as
trophies that ﬂatter its vanity and
testify to its strength. It has little
interest in money, but sometimes
accepts gold and jewels as tribute.
Manticore
The manticore is a monstrous amalgamation of lion, dragon, and human with a
penchant for feasting on human ﬂesh. Its distinctive tail is festooned with large
quills like those of a porcupine, which the manticore ﬂings at prey by whipping
its tail like a sling. These deadly spikes give the manticore the power to slaughter
even well-armed warriors from the safety of the sky.
Although the anthropomorphic face of the manticore suggests a keen intellect,
most creatures of its kind are simple-minded killers. They can be clever liars,
however, and their voices have a strangely musical sound that has lured many
unwitting travelers into an ambush. A manticore discovered by uneducated
humanoids (especially those who are both lawful and evil) can sometimes become
the center of adoration and even worship; a manticore in this situation swiftly
gives in to its laziness and allows its acolytes to bring it tribute in the form of
food and treasure, feasting upon its own followers when offerings become scarce.
Stronger humanoids who encounter a manticore can cow it through intimidation
and violence, sometimes even forcing it into service as a mount. As long as the
manticore is well fed with human ﬂesh and its master leads it to victory, a manticore
mount can prove surprisingly loyal.

the manticore makes a separate
Strike against each; this counts as
only one Strike for the manticore’s
multiple attack penalty, and the
penalty doesn’t increase until after
both attacks. If the manticore ﬁres
both spikes at the same creature, it
makes a single Strike. If the attack hits, it
deals the damage of a single spike, but the target
is pinned in place, rendering it immobilized. A
creature that succeeds at a DC 23 Athletics
check (attempted as a single action) can
pull the spike free.
A manticore can hurl no more than 12
spikes in 24 hours.
MANTICORE LOCATIONS
Manticores prefer lonely places
in the wilderness far from
humanoids, but they adapt
easily to nearly any terrain.
Manticores have been spotted in
jungles, forests, deserts, and
mountains.
