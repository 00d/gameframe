Gestalt ̂ˬ (concentrate, divine, transmutation) Nine lantern
archons can use this activity, all within 1 round of the ﬁrst, to merge together to form
a composite being for 7 rounds that appears as a glowing warrior of light. The gestalt
has the base statistics of a legion archon (AC, saving throws, attacks, skills, Speeds,
and so on) but the spells and special abilities of a lantern archon. Additionally, it has
a ranged light ray Strike (+18 attack, Damage 3d4 ﬁre and 3d4 good), and the bonus
from its Lantern of Hope increases to +3. When the gestalt separates, its remaining
Hit Points are divided evenly among the lantern archons, and if the gestalt had fewer
than 9 HP, some of the lantern archons die.
Lantern of Hope Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, mental) The lantern archon
shines as a beacon of hope. Good allies within 30 feet gain a +1 status bonus to
damage rolls and to saving throws against crushing despair.

ARCHON LOCATIONS
While commonly found in Heaven,
archons can also be encountered
on the ﬁendish planes in their
endless crusade against evil. On
the Material Plane they are usually
encountered as advisors or saviors
to those in need.
Horned Archon
Horned archons are secretive and tireless sentinels and scouts, patrolling the Outer
Sphere’s untamed wilds for evil to eliminate and keeping small communities safe from
demons, devils, and worse. They resemble muscular humans with the head, horns,
and legs of a stag. When requested to do so by their patrons, especially Erastil, they
journey to the Material Plane and patrol dangerous frontier areas, secretly performing
acts of kindness such as leading hunters to food, helping lost children, and driving off
evil creatures. Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana and Elysium, horned archons
are among the best at understanding the perspectives of other celestials.

# LEGION ARCHON
================================================================================


Bestiary
Legion Archon
Despite their ﬂaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of
peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual beneﬁt
rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to ﬁght against ﬁendish
powers—especially ﬁends that embody the sin of wrath—legion archons don’t
hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.

ARCHON AESTHETICS
While archons do not seek to
gather or maintain wealth, they
do appreciate beauty and art, and
their domains are often decorated
with valuable crafts and creative
works. Their armor and weapons
are similarly ornate, and they
always clean and polish their gear
after battle. Archons value order—
and thus tidiness—in all things.
of justice. A legion archon can throw its ﬂame of justice as a ranged weapon. If
disarmed or thrown, the ﬂame of justice vanishes after landing or dealing damage
and reappears in the legion archon’s hands again instantly. On a critical hit, the ﬁre
damage from the ﬂame of justice deals maximum damage (6 on the d6) before being
doubled for the critical hit, and the target takes 1d10 persistent ﬁre damage.

OTHER ARCHONS
Many other archons than those
presented here patrol Heaven or
crusade in the ﬁendish planes,
including the resolute hound
archon soldiers and sentinels,
and the supreme bastion archons,
who rank among Heaven’s most
powerful defenders.
Shield Archon
Shield archons defend the fortresses of Heaven against ﬁendish incursions. They
wield their spears and shields in massive formations capable of withstanding any
onslaught. Beneath their armor, they are sheathed in skin of steel. Given their
tremendous strength and imposing stature, shield archons are ideal guardians
of the meek and are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane to ward off the
attacks of great numbers of evildoers.

WANDERING AZATAS
While the idyllic realm of Elysium
is the home plane of azatas, their
overwhelming curiosity and
natural wanderlust often lead
them to travel far from this plane.
On other planes, they can be
seeking to right wrongs, looking
for entertainment, or merely
exploring to see the sights. More
than a few azatas, taken by a
whimsical urge to spread their
sometimes unwelcome jocosity,
see it as their duty to tease uptight
or humorless mortal creatures.
Gancanagh (Passion Azata)
Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments of
free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but earnest
ﬂings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve Cayden
Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium
who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings
that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the
demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love.
One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a
creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed
paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy
drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can’t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many
gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes
them look dapper. They cherish their silver ﬂutes, for they enjoy the beauty of
ﬂutes’ music and its ability to sway the heart.
The majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of
gender to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely,
is much more ﬂuid and open to interpretation than for many mortals.
Gancanaghs enjoy using this ﬂexibility to confront and test mortals’
convictions when faced with fear or prejudice, but when encountering
mortals who themselves are open-minded about sexuality or gender identity,
they can become lifelong allies. For those who are persecuted for such reasons,
gancanaghs are tireless defenders and eager supporters, quick to provide safety
and to punish those who would attempt to impose narrower beliefs upon a
world that deserves more diversity than it often gets. If possible, a gancanagh
seeks to educate and redeem those who hold destructive beliefs or prejudices,
resorting to combat only to defend themself or an endangered mortal, or when
no other option seems tenable—yet even then, they ﬁght with sadness.

AZATA TREASURES
While azatas would like to think
they are above material wealth,
the truth is that most azatas adore
ﬁnery and displays of beauty or
grandeur. They might explain away
bejeweled weapons as necessary
tools against the forces of evil,
or the wild array of jewelry and
silks they wear as important
diplomatic tools.
Lillend (Muse Azata)
Lillends are tale-tellers, chroniclers, and champions of freedom of expression.
They are generally peaceful, but are quick to act if a masterful piece of art
is threatened or free speech is suppressed. They pride themselves on inspiring
mortals to greater heights of expression and creativity, and more than one bard
looks to a lillend as their personal inspiration. Lillends sometimes secretly
follow the adventures of mortal heroes to record their stories as epic poems
and songs, which they then perform in the packed mead halls of Elysium. When
pursuing such goals, lillends take pains to use their innate spells to remain in
hiding, as they would rather observe and record events without “polluting” them
with their own intervention. Nevertheless, a lillend who sees their charge faced
with certain death often cannot resist the urge to intervene and save the day.
Inevitably, this brings a close to the lillend’s chronicles, as their relationship with
their subject invariably shifts from one of detached observation to friendship
or more. Yet lillends remain hesitant to involve themselves for
overlong in a mortal’s life, in part because they fear what sort of
ﬁendish attention their presence might attract, but mostly out
of respect for the mortal’s own destiny. A lillend would, all
things being equal, prefer to let mortals choose their own
fate rather than run the risk of sending someone down
a path to which their heart is not set.

OTHER AZATAS
The wilds of Elysium play host
to a wide array of azatas, the
most varied and widespread of
the celestials. From the foureyed mothlike uinuja to the
supernaturally verdant and
beautiful veranallia, whose lower
body is a wondrous garden of
wildﬂowers and plant life, azatas
are nothing if not diverse!
Ghaele (Crusader Azata)
Ghaeles are ﬁend-hunting knights of Elysium and champions of the freedom to take
up arms against oppressors and other evils. Ghaeles rarely engage directly in mortal
wars, but where ﬁends are involved they make an exception. A ghaele might assume
the guise of a mortal to ﬁght ﬁends alongside others, hoping to bolster morale and
teach good tactics against such supernatural foes. Ghaeles serve various deities and
empyreal lords of Elysium, though many have an afﬁnity for Cayden Cailean in
his capacity as a champion of freedom and defender of the downtrodden. Among
azatas, ghaeles are generally the quickest to shift to violence as a method of solving
problems, but even then they seek to minimize pain and suffering when they can.

oﬀ unwanted rodents, keeping
a big cat for a pet is a diﬀerent
matter entirely. Nevertheless,
up-and-coming merchant lords,
impetuous princes and princesses,
and status-obsessed nobles
have tried to do just that, often
resulting only in terriﬁed house
staﬀ and ruined upholstery. Many
among the idle rich will gladly pay
for the services of an unscrupulous
druid or ranger who promises to
help them achieve their dreams
of an oversized feline friend, but
the dire risks of such an endeavor
are enough to dissuade even the
greediest would-be animal trainers
from even attempting the feat.

a disease into full bloom. It chooses a target in its aura of pestilence that’s
currently aﬀected by a disease. That creature must attempt a Fortitude
save against the disease as if the interval for the disease’s current stage
had passed.
Astradaemon (Void Daemon)
These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct assault
against a soul or life-force—the same numbing death they bring with their fell
touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their
time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There,
they capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or
punishments and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters.
These horrifying predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of
the River of Souls in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims.
Psychopomps have a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes
between them and these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff
of legend.
THE DAEMONIC PARADOX
Daemons embody a fundamental
paradox—while they are
incarnations of death and seek
to devour all that lives, they are
themselves living creatures. Some
speak of a glorious end time after
which reality will ﬁnally be free
of the contagion that is life itself.
Most daemons give no thought to
this paradox.

Not all astradaemons limit their hunt to souls. The most notorious of their kind

# LEMURE
================================================================================


Bestiary
Devil
Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal
life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout
all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted
by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered
pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who
succumb to these temptations ﬁnd themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless
torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of
being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a speciﬁc
role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell,
from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly
lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized
devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit ﬁends command
entire infernal armies.
Lemure
These shapeless masses of quivering ﬂesh are the least of devilkind. Pathetic creatures
from Hell’s ﬁrst layer, lemures roam alongside damned and suffering souls. Pit
ﬁends can combine the essence of a mob of lemures to concentrate their collective
wickedness with a single form, granting it an infernal sentience and transforming it
into a more powerful devil (see the pit ﬁend’s Devil Shaping ability).

Subservience Lemures have little

to all lemures within 60 feet of it
with a single action, which has the
auditory and concentrate traits. The devil
picks one of the following orders lemures can understand, and the
lemures follow that order. The command and its eﬀects end once
the commander is out of the lemure’s sight, a new command is
issued by the same or another devil, or the lemure dies.
•
Kill The lemure attacks one target the commander
singles out and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack
rolls against the target.
•
Defend The lemure circles the commander and
attacks any creature that comes near. It gains a +1

or person the commander singles out. It attacks
anyone and anything that gets in the way.
•

dictated by the commander.
DIABOLIC DIVINITIES
Many unique and powerful devils
hold positions of power in Hell.
The most numerous of these are
the infernal dukes, many of whom
were promoted to this position
from already impressive statures
as pit ﬁends. The supreme ruler of
Hell itself is Asmodeus, the Prince
of Darkness. Between these two
tiers rule the eight archdevils—see
the sidebar on the facing page.

================================================================================
PAGE 88
================================================================================

ARCHDEVILS
At any one time, eight archdevils
rule the eight upper layers of Hell,
while the deepest layer is ruled
by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a
unique demigod with a dedicated
role in guiding the infernal machine
forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden
of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while
Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city.
Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries,
and Belial designs new weapons
for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the
oldest archdevil and keeper of many
secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs
armies. Baalzebul is a brooding
archdevil who has fallen from
Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty
Mephistopheles was formed from
the plane of Hell itself.
Imp
Imps are inﬁltrators and corruptors who, despite their diminutive stature, are
more than capable of subtly inﬂuencing a weak-willed individual into performing
increasingly evil acts over time. An imp will often agree to serve a mortal and
act docile and loyal in a long-term plot to eventually damn its master’s soul to
Hell. Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal souls, and
thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them leeway to
pursue their specialties. Despite standing a mere 2-feet tall, imps can be vicious
combatants, ﬂying out of reach and turning invisible to escape should the odds
turn against them.

strange hunter, however, lesser deaths hunt in packs on
rare occasions. More often than not, they manifest from
cursed magic items. Other times, they are just the enactors
of death, hunting in the same way the grim reaper does—
silently, with neither remorse nor quarter. Rarely, multiple
lesser deaths work together to cull a large population, their

devoid of life, inspiring (hopefully) false rumors of

ELDRITCH GODS
Gugs don’t traditionally make
religion and faith a key part of
their society, but gug cities always
feature prominent temples to
obscure gods whose faith has
passed from view on most mortal
worlds. Most gugs certainly know
of entities such as Azathoth,
Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth,
but even among gugs, these
Outer Gods are more feared and
respected than prayed to.
Gug
A gug’s most horrid feature is its barrel-shaped head, which splits vertically to
reveal numerous rows of sharp, yellow teeth and an open throat. Its eyes on
either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the
frantic ﬂailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi
and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair
of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with
shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.
Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs
lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark
nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most
gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims
and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed
paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked
with strange runes and sacriﬁced to the gugs’ wicked
gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors
tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of
stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders
preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.
Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which
seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean
world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them;
however, this strange fear doesn’t apply to ghasts, whom gugs
consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.
Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds,
although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies
their immense size. Their light step and ability
to squeeze through very small crannies makes
gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange
disappearances or bloody massacres.
Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain
awful powers as gifts from their eldritch
patrons. These monsters are known as savants,
are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells.
Though each savant’s precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant
invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and
destructive energies upon living ﬂesh.

# LICH

LICH TREASURE
The lair of a lich is usually ﬁlled
with several magical treasures,
particularly items that the undead
can use based on its spellcasting
abilities. Scrolls, wands, and
staves are quite common,
as are books of lore and
tomes containing entirely
new spells.
AlTERNaTE LICH ABIlITIES
Although the abilities on page 220 are standard for a lich, you can create a
more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful
presence, hand of the lich, Drain Phylactery, or paralyzing touch.
Blasphemous Utterances (arcane, aura, enchantment, mental) 10 feet. The lich is
accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A
creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental eﬀects
and can’t take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10
ﬂat check. Failing this check wastes the action.
Cold Beyond Cold The lich’s hand Strike deals cold damage instead of negative, and
instead of being paralyzed, the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces
this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success).
Dark Deliverance The lich has resistance to positive equal to its level.
Siphon Life Ǻȓ Trigger The lich deals damage with its hand Strike. Eﬀect The lich regains
Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt.
Void Shroud (aura, death, necromancy) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death,
drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich’s constant hunger. Living creatures in
the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death eﬀects. In
addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition
unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich’s spell DC – 4.
Lich
A wizard whose insatiable desire for arcane power eclipsed their
mortal life, the lich is a truly devious and versatile spellcaster.

UNIQUE LICHDOM
The exact ritual, ingredients
for deadly concoctions, and
magical conditions required to
become a lich are unique and
diﬀerent for every living creature.
Understanding a spellcaster’s path
to lichdom can help, but is no
guarantee of success for others.
LICH PHYLACTERY
ITEM 12
RARE
ARCANE
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Price 1,600 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
This item is crafted by a spellcaster who wishes to become a lich. When a lich is
destroyed, its soul ﬂees to the phylactery. The phylactery then rebuilds the lich’s undead
body over the course of 1d10 days. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the phylactery,
fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body).
A lich’s phylactery must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning.
The standard phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment inscribed
with magical phrases. This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more
durable or diﬃcult-to-obtain phylacteries. A phylactery might also come in the form of a
ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the speciﬁcs are up to the creator.
Demilich
Demiliches are formed when a lich, through carelessness or by accident, loses its
phylactery. As years pass, the lich’s body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull
as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left
wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses
the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form.
Negative energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and
teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull,
embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic,
forms a creature called a demilich.
Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time
to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich’s
hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power
in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich’s
skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some
theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the
demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is ﬁnally free to wander the
planes and ﬁnd new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the
Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear
in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.

LIZARDFOLK RELATIONS
Though most are neutral in
alignment, the typical iruxi’s pride
in their traditions, suspicion of
others, and need to protect their kin
can make them seem standoﬃsh or
even aggressive when encountered.
However, most are eager to learn
from visitors, trade stories
and equipment, and
forge alliances.
Lizardfolk
When human scholars speak of ancient civilizations, they usually turn their
focus to themselves, researching and lecturing on the ﬁrst human empires.
When they drift to others, they invariably look to cultures that had conﬂicts
or alliances with ancient humanity. That the culture of the people called
lizardfolk often gets ignored or forgotten even by well-meaning researchers is
thus no surprise, but to the lizardfolk themselves it is no matter. They know
their history and value its integrity and privacy—if younger ancestries like
humanity aren’t interested in learning from lizardfolk empires dating back
to before the ﬁrst human knocked two rocks together to make their ﬁrst
campﬁre, that’s ﬁne with them.
The word “lizardfolk” is an excellent example of humanity’s narrowsighted view of this culture. The name of their people is “iruxi,”
but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and
good-naturedly accepted the name “lizardfolk” as
a variant, and they generally resist urges
to call humans and other mammalians
similarly derivative names in return.
Iruxis dwell and thrive in all
tropical and temperate biomes, but
they are most at home in swamplands,
coastal regions, and riverlands, for they
are talented swimmers, and ﬁsh and
aquatic plants make up a large part of their
preferred diets.
Lizardfolk Defender
The lizardfolk defender serves as a protector of the young,
guardian of the settlement, and when no other options are available,
soldier in time of war. They eagerly rise to the defense of their kin but
do not revel in battle. An iruxi defender would rather turn back intruders
and allow them to ﬂee with the knowledge they were beaten, in hopes that
such word prevents further invasions, but they are not naive. The iruxi
understand the need for revenge, and when they allow a foe to escape,
they do not forget.

LIZARDFOLK SOCIETY
Iruxis are, as a general rule,
quite religious. Those who
venerate deities typically look to
Gozreh, but some of them ﬁnd
the teachings of Desna to be
compelling. Most iruxis, though,
instead follow druidic traditions,
ancestor worship, and astrological
philosophies in particular.
Lizardfolk Scout
Iruxi scouts are the lizardfolk most often encountered by adventurers, for
these explorers and hunters spend most of their lives on the move, constantly
patrolling the territories held by their enclave. If intruders are driven off, it is the
responsibility of the iruxi scouts to track them, observe them, and learn their ways
and weaknesses so as to report back to the community and aid in the defense
against potential reprisals.

Bestiary
MANTICORE TREASURE
A manticore enjoys taking plunder
from the corpses of its prey as
trophies that ﬂatter its vanity and
testify to its strength. It has little
interest in money, but sometimes
accepts gold and jewels as tribute.
Manticore
The manticore is a monstrous amalgamation of lion, dragon, and human with a
penchant for feasting on human ﬂesh. Its distinctive tail is festooned with large
quills like those of a porcupine, which the manticore ﬂings at prey by whipping
its tail like a sling. These deadly spikes give the manticore the power to slaughter
even well-armed warriors from the safety of the sky.
Although the anthropomorphic face of the manticore suggests a keen intellect,
most creatures of its kind are simple-minded killers. They can be clever liars,
however, and their voices have a strangely musical sound that has lured many
unwitting travelers into an ambush. A manticore discovered by uneducated
humanoids (especially those who are both lawful and evil) can sometimes become
the center of adoration and even worship; a manticore in this situation swiftly
gives in to its laziness and allows its acolytes to bring it tribute in the form of
food and treasure, feasting upon its own followers when offerings become scarce.
Stronger humanoids who encounter a manticore can cow it through intimidation
and violence, sometimes even forcing it into service as a mount. As long as the
manticore is well fed with human ﬂesh and its master leads it to victory, a manticore
mount can prove surprisingly loyal.
