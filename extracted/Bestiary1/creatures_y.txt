# YOUNG BLACK DRAGON
================================================================================


SERZILIAN
The great wyrm black dragon
Serzilian rules over the fetid
Graidmere swamp in Ustalav, where
she has resided for over 800 years.
She knows something darker even
than herself resides somewhere in
the swamp, but she has yet to ﬁnd
how to summon such an entity. For
now, she slumbers, waking only to
demand sacriﬁces.
Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The ﬂoors are littered with rotting
meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid
twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes,
and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do
with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure
hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer
substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.

DEYRUBRUJAN
Responsible for destroying three
separate villages in Avistan after
a lengthy raid to seek hidden
information, this great wyrm blue
dragon maintains a fortress lair in
the desert nation of Thuvia. Called
Hidden Nest, Deyrubrujan’s lair
is a factory where Usij cultists
manufacture all manner of
potions, drugs, and poisons, while
ultimately seeking a way to make
a counterfeit Sun Orchid Elixir.
Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They
make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in
battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to
destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their
desert lairs.
The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and
secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in
comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can
come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions
conceal the ediﬁce from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a
blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel—
expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.

DRAGONS ON OTHER
WORLDS
On the planet Triaxus the
Wanderer, the seventh world from
Golarion’s sun, dragons rule entire
continents. There, ancient dragons
maintain city-states and nations.
In a vast region known as the
Drakelands, chromatic dragons
have subjugated the humanoid
inhabitants and frequently war
among themselves. However, a few
good dragons maintain holdings
there. In the region knowns as
the Skyﬁre Mandate, a diﬀerent
dynamic exists: good dragons who
chose to work in harmony with the
humanoid inhabitants have created
a buﬀer against the tyrants of
the Drakelands. There, creatures
known as dragonkin work
alongside humanoids to patrol
the border, making up a group
known as the Dragon Legion.

Manipulate Flames Ȱɵ (arcane, concentrate, transmutation); The red dragon attempts
to take control of a magical ﬁre or a ﬁre spell within 100 feet. If it succeeds at a
counteract check (counteract level 10, counteract modiﬁer +32), the original caster
loses control of the spell or magic ﬁre, control is transferred to the dragon, and the
dragon counts as having Sustained the Spell with this action (if applicable). The dragon
can choose to end the spell instead of taking control, if it chooses.
White Dragon
The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons
are brutish, predatory, and chieﬂy motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all
other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull,
though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean
the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because
they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are
as difﬁcult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed
at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane
jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack
comes, it’s bloody and relentless.
Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from
people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding
tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds.
They ﬂy out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass
near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy
niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference
for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and ﬁne food—over coins
or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly
to their speciﬁcations, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their
homes over the years.

Flying within 10 feet of the ground. Each creature on the ground within 10 feet must
succeed at a DC 24 Reﬂex save or fall prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The
dragon can then Step.

it touches, up to 10 feet across. Any creature standing atop the ice must succeed at a
DC 15 Reﬂex save or Acrobatics check. On a failure, the creature falls prone atop the
ice; on a critical failure, it falls oﬀ the ice entirely and is also prone.

# YOUNG BRASS DRAGON
================================================================================


Brass Dragon
Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They
particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids,
delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them
haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage
in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics
so they can anticipate future conﬂicts. Along the way, they create extensive
information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all
levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly
assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue
dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice
and equality.
These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all
creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm
others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short
attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their
twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets
and houseplants that they can care for.
Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity
concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in
battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose
territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe
indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and
unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.
Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and
while they keep their lairs hidden, they often
build near humanoid settlements.

# YOUNG BRONZE DRAGON
================================================================================


Bronze Dragon
Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most
likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly
creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off
on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists,
guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze
dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to
crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to ﬁnd an important location worthy of
their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.
Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and afﬁnity for electricity means they are
a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly
discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath.
Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.
While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more
resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline,
of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons
keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, ﬂawless
pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.

any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons
purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.
A gold dragon’s incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means
they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the
rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for
there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate
advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of
garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a
gold dragon’s last-minute intermediation.
Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands
where they can enjoy long, meditative ﬂights without attracting the attention
of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren,
remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortiﬁed lair, such as a forgotten
sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons
may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live
truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and
magical wards.

usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even
more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive
clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.
Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens
of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides.
In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil
from taking root in the ﬁrst place, and they ensure mortals under their care are
well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem
overzealous or even eager to join the ﬁght against evil, they know that the best
way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment
at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable
problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for
evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support
of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.
Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating
deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice,
virtue, and redemption.

Bestiary
YETI TREASURE
Lone exiles of yeti clans have little
use for treasure and leave the gear
of their slain victims behind where
it is quickly covered by snowfall.
Clan-based yetis, on the other
hand, create beautifully carved
stonework, some of which they
shape into protective talismans of
rare beauty.
Yeti
Nearly a myth, the yeti is rarely seen—and even when it is, it is often too late.
Yetis dwell amid the highest, most remote peaks of the world, coming down
from their snowy mountain holds to raid, steal livestock, and sometimes feed
their insatiable urges for slaughter and destruction. Those folks who live at the
foot of a yeti-ruled mountain warn of the “abominable snowmen”: monstrous,
fur-covered humanoids who leave strange and bloody tracks in the snow.
Normally yetis seek to protect the world rather than hunt its other civilized
denizens. They do so by lairing near eldritch portals that form links between
the Material Plane and other, much stranger dimensions of reality. From within
these snow-covered arches and ancient stone doorways, aliens, living nightmares,
ﬁends, and worse can emerge through dimensional networks into the world. Yetis
who guard these portals sometimes succumb to these horrors and are corrupted,
taking on the bloodthirsty urges and horriﬁc behaviors of the very monsters they
strive to protect the world against. Yetis who manifest such violent tendencies
are driven out of their clan and forced to wander the mountaintops alone, thus
giving rise to the myth of the legendary abominable snowman. Forced to fend
for themselves, these exiled yetis often fully embrace the corrupting elements that
caused their exile in the ﬁrst place, growing more powerful and more deadly as
a result. The most vile of these yetis turn to cannibalism, not out of need, but
out of a sheer joy at the terror they inﬂict upon their kin. Invariably such
cannibalistic yetis attract the attention of wendigos, which makes a bad
situation all the worse.

gaining a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls and a –1 status penalty
to AC.
Vanish Ǻȓ Trigger The yeti is hidden or undetected while not in combat,
and a creature would observe it. Eﬀect The yeti Strides or Climbs up to
half its Speed to a location where it can Hide, then Hides. If its new Stealth
check result meets or exceeds the triggering creature’s Perception DC, the yeti
remains hidden.

ZARAMUUN TREASURE
Zaramuuns collect treasure from
mortals they have robbed or
sacriﬁced. They are attracted to
gems, rare metals, and potent
pieces of crafted earth, particularly
powerful magic items associated
with the Plane of Earth.
Zaramuun
Zaramuuns are beings of elemental sand that hide in deserts and wastelands. They
disguise themselves as massive dunes before rising up to attack living creatures. The
most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they ﬁnd, but others simply rob
their victims of all metal and stone possessions before ﬂeeing. Although zaramuuns
insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral earth, this is
simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as payment and material
components to conjure ﬁends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from the Plane of Earth
after worshipping ﬁends who promised to give them power over other elementals.
This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many zaramuuns believe
that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be set free.
