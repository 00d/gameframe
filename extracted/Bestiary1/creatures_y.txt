================================================================================


SERZILIAN
The great wyrm black dragon
Serzilian rules over the fetid
Graidmere swamp in Ustalav, where
she has resided for over 800 years.
She knows something darker even
than herself resides somewhere in
the swamp, but she has yet to ﬁnd
how to summon such an entity. For
now, she slumbers, waking only to
demand sacriﬁces.
Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The ﬂoors are littered with rotting
meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid
twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes,
and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do
with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure
hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer
substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.

DEYRUBRUJAN
Responsible for destroying three
separate villages in Avistan after
a lengthy raid to seek hidden
information, this great wyrm blue
dragon maintains a fortress lair in
the desert nation of Thuvia. Called
Hidden Nest, Deyrubrujan’s lair
is a factory where Usij cultists
manufacture all manner of
potions, drugs, and poisons, while
ultimately seeking a way to make
a counterfeit Sun Orchid Elixir.
Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They
make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in
battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to
destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their
desert lairs.
The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and
secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in
comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can
come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions
conceal the ediﬁce from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a
blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel—
expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.

On the planet Triaxus the
Wanderer, the seventh world from
Golarion’s sun, dragons rule entire
continents. There, ancient dragons
maintain city-states and nations.

dynamic exists: good dragons who
chose to work in harmony with the
humanoid inhabitants have created
a buﬀer against the tyrants of
the Drakelands. There, creatures
known as dragonkin work
alongside humanoids to patrol
the border, making up a group
known as the Dragon Legion.

ZARAMUUN TREASURE
Zaramuuns collect treasure from
mortals they have robbed or
sacriﬁced. They are attracted to
gems, rare metals, and potent
pieces of crafted earth, particularly
powerful magic items associated
with the Plane of Earth.
Zaramuun
Zaramuuns are beings of elemental sand that hide in deserts and wastelands. They
disguise themselves as massive dunes before rising up to attack living creatures. The
most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they ﬁnd, but others simply rob
their victims of all metal and stone possessions before ﬂeeing. Although zaramuuns
insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral earth, this is
simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as payment and material
components to conjure ﬁends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from the Plane of Earth
after worshipping ﬁends who promised to give them power over other elementals.
This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many zaramuuns believe
that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be set free.
