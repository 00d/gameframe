ALICORN
In alchemical and occult circles,
“alicorn” is the word for the
material that makes up a unicorn’s
horn, also used to describe any
object made from that horn. Note
that in many markets, alicorn sales
are illegal, and those who attempt
to sell alicorn are viewed with
repugnance—or worse.
Unicorn
Symbols of grace and purity, unicorns resemble proud and noble horses. They
are typically pure white of coat, but they are best known for the single, delicate
horn that extends from the center of their forehead. While unicorns often serve
as protectors of unspoiled wilderness and sacred places, they are themselves
highly sought after for their horns, which are said to possess potent magical
properties. To many, the mere idea of hunting such a magniﬁcent creature in the
hopes of severing its horn is utterly reprehensible. Indeed, a de-horned unicorn
is a sorry sight, and few such unicorns survive much longer in the wild.
Unicorns are found almost exclusively in remote, unsullied areas of wilderness.
Sometimes associated with good-aligned deities, other times associated with nature
and the fey, unicorns are always known for their righteousness and nobility. They
are wary, at best, of most humanoid creatures, due in large part for poachers’
tendency to hunt them for their horns, but unicorns are often rumored to have
a weakness for those who are pure of both heart and spirit. Despite some tales,
unicorns are equally likely to recognize purity in young men as in young women.

OUTCASTS OF AIR
Uthuls are thought to be an
outcast group of beings that once
dwelled on the Plane of Air. It is
unclear whether their fury was
the reason for their expulsion
from that plane or if they grew
implacable after being banished.
Uthuls do not speak of their
history to anyone and simply
redouble their unending rage on
any who dare to ask.
Uthul
An uthul most often appears to be a dark, swirling cloud ﬁlled with ﬂying debris
and streaked with sudden ﬂashes of lightning. Although they are clearly elemental
in nature, uthuls are nearly always found on the Material Plane, where they hide
among natural cloud formations, especially thunderstorms.

The bolt deals 6d12 electricity damage

creature in a 20-foot emanation must
attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save. The uthul

Whirlwind Form ʚʖ (concentrate) The uthul transforms itself into a swirling
vortex of storm and fury 10 feet wide and up to 40 feet tall. It stays
in this form for 3 rounds or until it Dismisses the eﬀect. While in
this form, the uthul gains resistance 10 to physical damage and can
move through other creatures. Its aura remains active, but it can’t
make debris Strikes nor use Lightning Crash. Instead, any creature
the uthul moves through takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and
2d12 electricity damage. A creature can take this damage
only once per round. A Large or smaller creature
must also succeed at a DC 32 Reﬂex save or be
picked up and held suspended within the vortex.
Suspended creatures move with the uthul. A
creature can attempt to escape by spending an
action to attempt a DC 32 Reﬂex save (or a DC 32
Acrobatics check to maneuver in ﬂight if it has a
ﬂy Speed). Upon escaping, or when the uthul
transforms back into its storm cloud form, a
suspended creature is hurled 1d4 × 10 feet in
a random direction, then falls unless it can ﬂy
or otherwise remain aloft. After returning to
its normal form, the uthul must wait 1 minute
before it can use Whirlwind Form again.

BUILDING VAMPIRES
Because vampires can inﬂict their
nature upon any creature whose
blood they drink, practically any
living monster can become one
of these undead horrors. When
you need to create a vampire for
your game, you can do so in two
ways. In most cases, it’s more
eﬀective to build the vampire
from the ground up, using the
standard rules for monster
creation (this is how the vampire
count, vampire spawn, and
vampire mastermind presented
on these pages were built). Or you
can use the guidelines presented
under Creating a Vampire to turn
an existing creature (or even a
player character!) into a vampire,
adjusting the monster as you see
ﬁt. In either case, speciﬁc vampire
abilities like coﬃn restoration,
Mist Escape, and Drink Blood work
the same.
Vampire
Vampires are undead creatures that feed on the blood of the living.
Creating a Vampire
You can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil.
•	 Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 1.
•	 Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability
can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon’s breath weapon),
increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Reduce HP by the amount listed on the table.
•	 The vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except
silver) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire
has less HP.

BASIC VAMPIRE AbILITIES
All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that
speciﬁcally come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any
traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid.
You might also need to adjust abilities that conﬂict with the vampire’s theme.
Negative Healing
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep
Coﬃn Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn’t
destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious. If its body rests in its coﬃn for 1 hour,
the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.
Vampire Weaknesses All vampires possess the following weaknesses.
•	 Compulsions Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A
typical vampire can’t voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it
hides within its coﬃn, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone
with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have diﬀerent
compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without
being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and
might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion (see below).
•	 Revulsion A vampire can’t voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a
brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol,
a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire
involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the ﬂeeing
condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet.
After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt
a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it
overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).
•	 Stake A wooden stake driven through a vampire’s heart drops the vampire to 0
HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coﬃn. Staking a vampire
requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is
removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it’s in its coﬃn the 1-hour
rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire’s head is severed and
anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.
•	 Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The
slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the

VAMPIRES AND DHAMPIR
The most common and traditional
vampires, as presented here, are
known also as the “moroi.” They
are prevalent in Golarion in the
mist-shrouded counties of Ustalav
and found in small numbers in
almost every nation of the Inner
Sea. Other types of vampires
include the withered nosferatu,
the hopping jiang shi, and the
psychic vetala—these vampires
share many of the basic traits
with moroi but possess new
abilities of their own. Dhampir
(page 95) can be born of any
of these vampire races, though
moroi-born dhampir known as
svetochers are the most common,
especially in the Inner Sea region.
vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural
aversion to light, vampires don’t cast shadows or show a reﬂection in mirrors.
Climb Speed Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.
Claws If the creature had hands, its ﬁngernails thicken and grow, granting it an unarmed
claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had
any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the
damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal
three-quarters that damage.
Drink Blood Ȱɵ (divine, necromancy); Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained,
unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire’s reach. Eﬀect The vampire sinks
its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against
the victim’s Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other
conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its
maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a
creature that’s already drained doesn’t restore any HP to the vampire but increases
the victim’s drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that’s been emptied
into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.
A victim’s drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion,
which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor,
reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.
Grab The creature’s claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab.
TRUE VAMPIRE AbILITIES
Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain
additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a
signiﬁcant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply
make such a creature into a regular vampire spawn, or rebuild the creature so that
it’s at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.
Resistances The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver.
Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced
to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating
some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If
the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator’s control. If a
vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed
spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the
vampire’s Will DC.
Mist Escape Ȳ˓ Trigger The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. Eﬀect The vampire uses Turn to
Mist (page 320). It can take move actions to move toward its coﬃn even though it’s
at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaﬀected by further damage. It
automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coﬃn or after
2 hours, whichever comes ﬁrst.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The vampire
transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Most vampires
can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a diﬀerent creature, such as a rat or a wolf.
Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines.
•	 Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat (page 39). It gains
echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a ﬂy Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs
Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the
same amount of damage as the vampire’s claws, but deal piercing damage rather
than slashing damage.
Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The vampire’s presence brings
forth creatures of the night to do the master’s bidding. These typically include rat
swarms, bat swarms, and wolves, but can include other creatures. The vampire can
give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they
can’t communicate back.
Dominate ʚʖ (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire
can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into

SPAWN LOCATIONS
Vampire spawn live wherever their
masters demand. When free of any
master, they tend to roam in packs
through slums or other urban
areas that wouldn’t notice a few
people going missing.
the target’s eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the
vampire’s level (Core Rulebook 503), and a creature that succeeds is temporarily
immune to that vampire’s Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends
the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insuﬃcient to break
the spell.
Drink Blood As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1.
Turn to Mist Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of
vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast
healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indeﬁnitely.
Vampire Spawn
Vampires use their spawn for inﬁltration and reconnaissance.
