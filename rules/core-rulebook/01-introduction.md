# Chapter 1: Introduction

## What Is Roleplaying?

Roleplaying games (RPGs) are a form of interactive storytelling where players create and control characters in a shared imaginary world. The Game Master (GM) describes the world and narrates the story, while players describe their characters' actions and decisions. The outcomes are determined by the rules of the game, often involving dice rolls to represent chance and skill.

In Pathfinder, you and your friends create heroes who explore ancient ruins, battle monstrous foes, and uncover lost treasures in the fantasy world of Golarion. You can be a mighty warrior, a cunning rogue, a wise wizard, or any of countless other archetypes.

## What Is Pathfinder?

Pathfinder is a tabletop RPG that emphasizes storytelling, strategy, and character customization. It's set in the richly detailed world of Golarion, filled with diverse cultures, magic, and adventure. Pathfinder uses the d20 system, where success is determined by rolling a 20-sided die and adding modifiers based on your character's abilities and skills.

Pathfinder Second Edition (often abbreviated as PF2e) is the current edition, featuring streamlined rules, balanced gameplay, and endless possibilities for adventure.

## How to Use This Book

This Core Rulebook contains all the essential rules for playing Pathfinder. If you're new to RPGs or Pathfinder, read this book from start to finish. Experienced players can use it as a reference.

The book is divided into chapters covering character creation, gameplay, and more. Appendices at the end provide quick reference for conditions, glossary, and other useful information.

## Key Terms

Here are some fundamental terms you'll encounter throughout the game:

- **Ability Scores**: Six core attributes that define your character's innate capabilities: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). Each ranges from 1 to 20+.

- **Alignment**: A moral and ethical compass for your character, ranging from Lawful Good to Chaotic Evil.

- **Check**: A test to see if your character succeeds at a task. Roll a d20, add relevant modifiers, and compare to a Difficulty Class (DC).

- **DC (Difficulty Class)**: The target number you need to meet or exceed on a check.

- **Action**: A discrete activity your character can perform in combat or exploration, such as attacking, moving, or casting a spell.

- **Round**: A segment of combat, lasting about 6 seconds, during which each participant acts once.

- **Turn**: Your character's opportunity to act during a round.

- **Encounter**: A scene with potential conflict, such as combat or a skill challenge.

- **Adventure**: A complete story arc, often consisting of multiple encounters.

- **Campaign**: An ongoing series of adventures.

## Dice

Pathfinder uses polyhedral dice, each with a different number of faces:

- d4: 4-sided die
- d6: 6-sided die
- d8: 8-sided die
- d10: 10-sided die
- d12: 12-sided die
- d20: 20-sided die
- d100: 100-sided die (often represented as percentile dice)

You'll need a set of these dice to play. Most checks use d20 + modifiers vs. DC.

## Character Basics

Your character is defined by:

- **Ancestry**: Your character's race or heritage (e.g., Human, Elf, Dwarf).

- **Background**: Your character's upbringing and early life experiences.

- **Class**: Your character's profession and primary abilities (e.g., Fighter, Wizard, Rogue).

- **Level**: Your character's experience and power, from 1 to 20.

- **Ability Scores**: As mentioned above.

- **Skills**: Trained abilities like Acrobatics, Stealth, or Arcana.

- **Feats**: Special talents and abilities.

- **Equipment**: Weapons, armor, tools, and gear.

## Gameplay Overview

A typical Pathfinder session involves:

1. **Preparation**: The GM prepares an adventure, players create or level up characters.

2. **Exploration**: Players travel, gather information, and interact with the world.

3. **Encounters**: Challenges like combat, puzzles, or social interactions.

4. **Downtime**: Time between adventures for crafting, training, or roleplaying.

The GM adjudicates rules and narrates the story, while players make decisions for their characters.

## Example of Play

GM: "You enter the goblin cave. Two goblins stand guard, armed with spears."

Player 1 (Fighter): "I charge the nearest goblin and attack!"

Player 1 rolls a d20 + strength modifier + weapon proficiency vs. goblin's AC.

GM: "You hit! Roll damage."

And so on.
